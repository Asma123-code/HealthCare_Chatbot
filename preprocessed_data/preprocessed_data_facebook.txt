so when you ask what the two illness arethey be similar in that they tend to have moodiness involve impulsivity and selfdamage behavior for compensatory measure otherwise they be not really that similar but they do seem to like one another and often show up in the same personmake their life chaotic difficult dysfunctional and intense   so if your friend be concern that they may have one or both of these illness they should not be ashamed it be definitely not their fault they should instead get help from a professionaland insist that they be treat appropriately with the correct type of therapy and medication
in addition people with bpd quite often have a weak self concept they do not always know who they really be deep down inside they may always feel like there be something miss or something wrong with they intrinsically this can cause period of dissociation and difficulty in maintain a healthy sense of self esteem they may have a weak value system or one that be miss entirely or find that they have a difficult time adhere to whatever value system they do have since there be a real issue with trusting and blackwhite thinking they do not always trust in their own decision and may do thing to get people to like they or not leave they that would be against their value system normally and think that they themselves be terriblebadevil people for do it later they often take their mistake in life much more seriously than other people a normal person may make the same mistake and feel bad about it but it be unlikely that they will see themselves as terriblebadevil for having make the mistake oftentime a person with bpd would make that mistake and internalize it as a personal failurethat it happen because they themselves be awfulbadwrong this mean that their self concept be much more fluid than normal people   now please keep in mind that not all bpd sufferer have every single one of these symptom there be definitely other symptom that can be include in the diagnosis but this be a pretty good sta and the most common symptom sufferer may face people with bpd need intense therapy because they must change how they see themselves and the world around they have a more mature realistic viewpoint of the world that be not all black or all white rebuild value system and self concept that may be missingaberrant build the ability to trust othersself and learn cope mechanism dbt dialectic behavioral therapy be develop for bpd sufferer initially and have show some positive result for sufferer who adhere to the technique in their life   here be the thing too it be fairly common for bipolar and bpd to be comorbid in a person mean they have both at the same time we do not necessarily know if there be a genetic link between they but we be begin to think that be possible a person suffer from both at the same time untreated would tend to be extremely emotional moody hypersensitive to criticism untruste selfdamage with high and low in behavior that make their life and the life of those who love they quite difficult they be chaotic because their brain be not work correctly due to chemical imbalance and at the same time their perception of themselves other people and the world be one base on distrust and fear of be abandon or reject they tend to have problem with love relationship friendship family relationship and relationship with coworker quite often they end up be in the hospital for suicidal ideation or for mania more often for depression than mania it be not uncommon for they to end up in the system for some time before they get a proper and correct diagnosis and a good treatment plan they may get kick out of the system early with a misdiagnosis which lead to poor management of symptom and relapse
borderline personality disorder like all other personality disorder be an abnormal way of perceive and interact with the world think of it as have a diy filter that the sufferer see the world through constantly we do not believe it be cause by chemical imbalance in the brain but it be possible that some of the symptom might because medication can help some sufferer but do not help everyone because they perceive thing incorrectly they often react inappropriately to situation that occur people with bpd typically not always as there be some room for deviation have problem with emotional regulation and may react incorrectly to unexpected situation that occur they may be perceive by other as be moody and reactive they often have problem with trust other people it be believe this occur because of unhealthy childhood experience with parent caregiver teacher and peer however there may also be a genetic propensity for people to have bpd as well regardless they tend to have sholive intense relationship with lover where they cling one minute and push away the next they often have issue with infidelity due to a fear that they will be abandon there be a real fear of abandonment and rejection they tend to have black and white think thing be all wrong or all good and that mean they often either idealize or villainize their lover depend on their mood this leave the lover often feelle like they do not really know what be go on or where they stand in the relationship one minute the lover be be adore and the next they be be push away if there be infidelity or other type of selfdamage risky behavior occur the lover may eventually get feed up because of this behavior and their intense lack of trust quite oftenthe sufferer do because their lover to leave they this of course reinforce their belief that they will always be abandon leave andor aloneand the cycle of clingingpushe away sta again with a new person usually quite soon afterward it should be notedthis black and white thinking tend to color their perception and behavior in regard to themselves their self esteem their self concept and the world around they quite often they be hypersensitive to criticism or even perceive criticism this go back to that deep seed fear of be reject or abandon more than likely they live in a household situation with a parent or caregiver who wouldone minute seemingly dote on the child and the next without obvious reasonpush the child away inconsistent inattentive cold neglectful or absentee parenting seem to be a big pa of the reason a person with bpd may have have it develop since we learn to trust from the first people in our life usually our parentsif a parent prove to be untrustwohy absent cold or inconsistent with affectionpunishmenta child may learn that they can not trust anyone deep down people with bpd do not always trust themselves either   because they tend to have very black and white thinking they do not always handle situation very well this just world concept where they seem to think that good thing happen to good people and bad thing happen to bad people can cause they to see themselves as badevilwrong if something bad happen to they even thing they can not control   in addition they often have feeling of intense anger if thing do not go as they expect especially if it deal with other people their expectation of other people be usually unrealistic because their expectation of themselves and the world be unrealistic generally they may get physically violent or abusive when thing do not go the way they expect during a period of devaluation of their love paner they may become violent or abusive note this do not happen with every bpd sufferer but it be a common enough occurrence that it should be say   they have intense change in feeling and react quickly to situation without always think thing through they can be selfdamage and impulsive this be where people get it confuse with bipolar disease because bipolar tend to cause high and low and emotional reactivity during those period people with bpd have this issue all the time howevernot just when they be experience a disease relapse from one extreme or the other
long answer bipolar disease be cause by a chemical imbalance in the brain it can be treat with medication and therapy typically people with bipolar disease have learn to compensate for it in unhealthy way illegal drug use eat disorder gambling promiscuity alcoholism self harm etc and therapy can assist they with overcome these unhealthy cope mechanism in addition they may need therapy that assist with rebuild family relationship that the sufferer while in a relapse state have damage bipolar disease often cause lability of emotional response and potentially selfdamage behavior that come from that they tend to have period of maniahypomania and depression that be severe during mania they may feel like they have more energy be happy without reason have grandiose idea of themself and their ability need less sleep be much more sexual and engage in risky behavior without consider the consequence during depression they may be suicidal incapable of care for themself engage in selfharm have a hard time leave their housebed and miss a lot of work depend on what type of bipolar a person have or where they fall on the spectrum determine quite often how serious their period of maniahypomania be and how long those occurand how serious their depressive episode be and how long those occur regardless it be a difficult situation they live with constantly medication typically work to counterbalance the chemical imbalance in their brain or offset the symptom so that they can function somewhat normally without huge high and low
well think of bipolar as a rollar coaster you have high and low peak where your mood can either rapidly alternate up and down or have the longwr last shift up that last for day ect depression and anger be two of the most common now as for borderline personality   its more like a tilt a wirl your mood can go secerap direction and rapidly   impulsivness be a major pa of it as well not make sound judgement and just do not to mention reation to situation that be commonly deem inappropriate I myself suffer from both and it take I along time to become stable and someday I still struggle with it
believe I I show you much more than anyone I still have lot of work to do but I trust you completely I hope you feel the same   you can share anything with I li no worry
yes I feel the exact same way my family avoid I all waysalway now I have no place in my family and no voice either I now choose not to give they any info if at all possible all they do now be hu I and leave I out of all family function and matter because I be not strong enough this be the time you find   your true family and friend facebook have help I tremendously I will not validate their behavior because it be so stereotypical they choose to remain ignorant

a family session can be helpful   you need to be ready for that though have a family session may allow for they to gain an improved understanding of your symptom and mood   this may also allow for you though well understand what they be have difficulty with I   relate to you   not as one weigh mi rather as the family you be you be work already ight sound like on insight sand awareness   keep at it try not though be discourage by the action of other   ultimately we be responsible for our own happiness I struggle to with relationship so I appreciate what you be deal with   good luck
yes iam like this at time but they seem to wind we up too its not all what we say   but I be careful at time how I speak or I do not speak at all that be easy lol   try and think before we speak but I know when we get stress its hard and all sos come tumble out   stay strong
my brother send I one do not disturb I be disturb enough already
when I tell a former employer about my bipolar I feel like he be always nervous that I might fly into a rage at anytime I be not even the angry kind of bipolar I be really just the sad kind but since that job I have learn to keep it to myself I have say that I have have a bad cold if I be too depressed to work
the only problem I have be when I be randomly   put on a grave yard shift that mean I can not take my med as they make I so tired I have   kid and can not just catch up on my sleep and end up with anxiety and not be able to sleep from not take my med be able to have a stable and normal shift all week make my week x well than it would have if all shift be different and there be random grave
my job be just crazy you basically do   job in one and we put people live on the line so we have to be   on our game it be just really hard for my brain to bounce from position to position in the same day I feel like I can not keep up and then I get anxious and sta talk crap and say thing I do not really mean I be just say they to try to calm down
at least you people be on med I be without it be a struggle everyday for I not want to live cz I get into these crazy ass episode and it be hard to control but it be easy for people that do not have this issue to tell I to fke snap out of it  
I be a   itch   and I be not on medication because I have no fking medical insurance for my bipolar depression and anxiety so I have too deal with it myself and people around I I can not stand who I be but I feel stuck like you and hopeless
no I be the same way sometimes I can not afford to get my med refill and I go off the deep end I feel so bad and my body feel so horable it be not your fault so do not worry just do the good you can
no   you be not the only one that suffer from the withdrawal of these damn pill   I too become a totally different person   call this complicated   hard to deal with   very easily annoy that be create by these big   pharmaceutical company and their man make so call medication when my friend see the slight bit of my alter ego come out be when along with the change of myself be when my name change as well   I then become evilalina   funny yet sad   deal with the aftermath of evilalina sometimes put I into a deeply depressing state of mind I be not this irritate person I transform into which one one the main reason why I choose to medicate myself by medical marijuana   I have also knock out   of my daily pill   since evilalina rarely make her presence know
I be awful at remember to take mine I miss one day and I be a mess I miss two and I be completely unable to function anxiety induce rage be so awful
I be go through this now I bitch myself out and ton of negative self talk because I can not shake the guilt I be a miserable person to be around even skip one or two day I would like to think that med be not help since I still struggle plenty on they but it be when I miss a dose or two that I realize they be a life saver I would not function very long in a med free state of mind as it be I try to limit my interaction as much as possible so as to limit the stimulus that I will dwell on and beat myself up over I know your struggle all too well
no not alone I too have feel the guilt of my nonmedicated self I have to stay on med no skipping
no you be not alone   if my med be not properly regulate I have blind rage outburst I be cranky   bitchy everything get on my nerve I yell like a banshee it be horrible you have to stay on top of the med
I def think it be way too much but you have to know your own body and by the fact yiur ask you must think so I would talk to my dr and if he will not adjust to your want then get another we be here to live lofe not be tie and chain to med and drs I understand about the sleeping when I get off my med   year ago that be my fear buti research and try other thibgs and I now sleep   hrs a night w nothing it be a daily task but I fewl so much well without all those med their side effect and stay stress have to remember to take they throughout the day now life be enjoyable I be not just go thru the motion good luck redhea
I too take seroquel it have do wonder for my sleep cycle and I now get the sleep I need I also take a high dose of effexor   antidepressant and buspar for anxiety this combination work well for I and this come to from year of try other med that do not have the desire result I suffer from bipolar   severe depression and anxiety   the amount of medication seem excessive but maybe you can eliminate some if they be not help you I be not a dr though so make sure you stop and sta your med with drs guidance good luck to you and I hope this help wish you peace and happiness
its always hard get a proper diagnosis often there be those who have more than one diagnosis my kid have adhd bipolar with sczophernic tendiciesi myself be bipolar anxiety and ptsd insomnia so I do take a lot of pill I like you have a lot of physical condition as well for which I take med the impoant thing be to let each doctor know what you be take also be proactive know medicine side effect read up on they it get confusing but the more you knw about they the more it be help
it be really just a matter of opinion my therapist today say that there be two side to depression how you think and the imbalance I have be on seroquel for   year and due to insomnia I too only get   hour of sleep without it which be the leading because of my issue depression phobia relate anxiety add gad his way of put it be that the prescription help you put on a different pair of glass until you can handle the sun again on your own I really like that
megan you be medication be more impoant that you take you be pill they will help you stay strong it be not anything more impoant than take my pilp I go manic offend and it be a struggle for I when I be like that I get so depressed that I do not come out of my room for day other then go to the bathroom please thqt you medication
I be tell to do this and it do work but here be a technique that at psychotherapist should advise you on for it to work I and a fear of die but it get I through a csection and I be allow to keep the band on x
what I hate its like hold your breath for the bad to happen while your body be act crazy give you danger signal    then the feeling never pass it stay with you horrible toure torment
stress ball maybe
you know what be be help I a fidget cube it fit in my hand and I have be actually fall asleep with it because that be when my anxiety be the bad I do not know about the band thing I have never hear of it but I be just let you know the cube help I especially if you be concerned about self harm
it be where you put an elastic band like a rubber band or hair tie on your wrist and when you sta to feel anxiousnervous or any other bad habitemotion you snap the band against your wrist it do not work for I because I have an extremely high pain tolerance
be a paner to someone who have a mental illness must be so hard but the thing you describe be true and honest trigger for I it be never an excuse it be a monster live in his head I have be in relationship where I be treat bad because of my bipolar and anxiety now I be married to the most calm and love man that never make I feel bad when I be have an episode or be trigger by something that seem ridiculous I be not try to be shitty but just because you work in mental health do not mean you be equip to live with it at home he just need your love and acceptance not blame and anger
can not you put the animal in crate and close the bedroom door so you guy could sleep together I know crate training take time but in the end you will both come to find out the less the animal disturb your sleep the well you both feel
firstly you be definately entitle to vent and I can imagine it would be extremely difficult to be in that situation its not fair that you be work so hard and lose sleep and be clearly struggle because you be exhausted can you make different arangement for the animal to sleep maybe in another room or something or maybe you could try a different sleeping arangement I think it would be a good idea to see a psychologist or consellor for yourself as well and try talk to he about how everything be affect you maybe you could go back to the doctor or a counsellor together to try to find a way to make thing work well its great that he have make improvement though
have he try therapy by chance therapy drain I and I end up drop out I be in group therapy but I also have ptsd and severe anxiety along with bp I could not take on hear other traumatic situation anymore it do teach I cope skill and renew cope skill I would forgot I have though I have never use my illness as an excuse to act out wrongly unfounately I do still get fluster from time to time and have outburst usually over the small thing before I can help myself but I try and stop it as soon as I realize it and I own up to it I admit I be wrong and apologize for I it be about be very vigilant of myself at all time especially since I do not do pharmaceutical perhaps therapy and learn such skill could benefit he I be sure he do not mean to be that wayit be just as exhausting for he as well believe it or not wish you strength and courage in work thru this   
it be not fair to reso to leave he then all relationship take work and dedication through everything hardship include throw a mental illness into the mix and it get difficult to the max   my husband and I both suffer from mental illness and it be an almost daily struggle to not lose our shit but we love each other we be dedicated to each other there be time when it feel like he do not understand my predicament and there be time I act like I do not understand his but at the end of the day or week our love prevail do not give up and just leave when there be enough love and dedication to survive through the storm it be not easy but nothing woh have ever be

I have bipolar and my husband have severe anxiety we celebrate our th wedding anniversary two day ago
not everyone be capable of handle the stress of be with someone with a mental illness and that be okay it be well to know your limit then put you and the other person in a situation neither can handle it may seem shallow to you nick kemp but it be more about be realistic in what you can handle
my husband have bad anxiety and be seriously insecure and he also have depression but he be still an amazing husband and father he be kind and funny and sweet and loving and compassionate he never let we I go a day without make sure I know he love I

write everything down you need to tell he this be impoant for your nerve will make you forget something be I have do it a lot and the doc need to hear as much as you can tell he to help you to I remember I be not a doc you have more than depression but that be why you need to write it down a list the list will make you not so scared too
yes   write it down   make note   talk with the psychiatrist   please know it be not a one   do situation   you talk to the psy then they assess and there be followup   please push yourself   be sure to share what you need   if you find you have forget something write it down for the next time   you say your doctor diagnose you   if you mean your normal primary care physician they be not qualified to make such a diagnosis and I sincerely hope he be not prescribe med for the condition without therapist or psychiatrist input I suffer from both anxiety   depression and be that same person that you describe above   please consider see a therapistcounselor as well as the psychiatrist   this way you get treatment and medication if you need it
hey thereyou will do great   I be terrify too and I do make some note to bring with I but for my assessment they basically go through my history from when I stae have trouble   so you could make some note on that esp if you be anxious but in my experience they be very understanding and make you feel at ease   you will definitely feel well afterward and they can figure out if your diagnosis be accurate   they can also help you learn to control the urge when you understand where they be come from   remember the beginning be the scary pa and you have work for this appointment   you will do fine

very brave to raise this symptom and for everyone who have post comment of suppo its a very real and sometimes very destructive symptom of bipolar and there should be no shame discuss it to everyone here that have share their experience off it I completely understand and relate to all those who be appal by the subject and feel the need to comment negatively why not just scroll past if its not relevant to you some of we already feel bad enough for have symptom we can not control your disgust in the subject be dangerous to those struggle to understand x x
I be pretty sure your in a manic stage    when I be manic I look at everyone and think they want I   I be a christian and I feel so guilty about my thought   it be my chemical   a brain be an amazing thing just look what human can do but with that say we be full of our own chemical so when your chemical be off in your brain our thought be distoe   my advice be call your doctor and talk to they    god bless   I be stable now and only want sex with my husband   I still love sex
I have no idea this be pa of my condition no dr or therapist ever mention it they always mention drug or alcohol but never sex so I be embarrassed to say anything about it thank to everyone who be open to help other

sueanna arnoldfolsom nothing wrong with masturbation it be normal and relieve stress
I work in mental health nurse a common side effect be hypersexuality it nowt b ashame off n it be great you talk about it as we encourage this so you do not feel alone act on your urge in positive way be great but should never feel guilty there r medication if you feel it be over power to a point it be a taking over ya mental health please do talk to ya consultant they will n do understand and a lot of people suffer you be not alone xx
when I be in mania mood I can not get enough I actually have multiple affair that I be not proud of and it cause a divorce I could not control it after I do it I feel so guilty I would cry and just lie in bed depress
anadrolyesthe anabolic steroiddid wonder for I aside from build lean muscle and cut the fat in the waist areagoe on the   week of hard training and take anadroli masturbate or have sex once a day after go off anadrol and while my body stae produce testosterone againi kind of find a safe and centered spot where I neither have erectile disfunctionor overkill sex drive again I be on lyricalorazepamezoloft and onzapineborderline bipolar and a petsistent anxious depression patient these medshello pfizer do it for meso there
but nobody ever talk about hypersexuality as a symptom mostly out of shame
when I be bad I can masturbate up to   time a day and the more I cum the more shame I feel to the point I be just depressed like when I be in a healthy state of mind its once or twice a day but hypersexuality can be rough luckily the med I be on stave off a lot of those pesky side effect otherwise I d be stare at ass and crotch all day unable to think about anything but what be under the clothe
horrible it be I could really do with one now but I can not and I be get annoy with my self
yeah the guilt be horrible I mastubate at least   time a day if I can and I be really guilty I just do not know why we get this feeling x
oh my gosh the guilt whenever I masturbate I get this guilty feeling in my gut like a depressive heaviness come over I I can not stand that why do this hapoen
I do take too many risk but not now settle and get kid so I can control that side I kind of just relive myself and then feel guilty
oh wow I too I be on   bipolar med and   anxiety and I still have sexual urge all the time but not as bad as when I be single at least I be not promiscuous anymore I take too many chance back in the day I be just glad I be not have to deal with consequence like hivrealky lucky
that be the bloody problem be find the right med I be on one for bi polar and one for social anxiety and the socal anxiety one be like bloody sex pill to mee
or the time I have sex in the living room with a marine and all of a sudden the light come on and I realize he be film it I have never be so worried in my life and that be nearly   year ago
I have not be diagnose with bipolar but this post really get my attention sound like I and I worry when I can not control it can I ask what your first symptom to get you the bipolar diagnosis   people can be addict to sex but I too be curious of people thought on this post
star honey my temper definitely have change year ago I use to get so angry not sure what change it but I do not get as angry but I do find myself annoy by the small thing and yell at my kid and later regret it I be on med for depression for anxiety my sex drive have lessen some but it seem once I find the right guy it seem to trigger the bad pa again ugh thank for share
I have never need to really use med to control my hyper sexuality think I should expand I use think censor during ceain situation and that be about it otherwise I allow myself to indulge safely in what my body crave maybe it be because I have never view sex like most of society do from what most people respond like it be not something to be ashamed of and not talk about issue like hyper sexuality just screw people up more of course be careful with whatever you choose to do but it be ultimately your choice just practice safety in all form
all the people complain about this do not understand and be most likely faker look for attention this be a real medical condition and judge someone due to have bipolar sex drive be horrid you need to leave not the people look for help or information
it be myself who ask for the post sorry but I be really struggle atm and this be the first place I could think about ask as you all well know opening up be hard no pun intend
hey its completely ok that you feel this way if you be in a relationship talk to your paner about your want and need in bed and talk to your counselor or dr if you be truly worried about it
do not worry shaun its normal my paner suffer the same way and sadly my medication turn off my libido but if you have an understand in paner you can work everything out in the end its totally normal and you should not be ashamed also want abuse in the bedroom be purely a bdsm fetish and again many many many people be into that so of thing as long as it be do in a safe sane and consensual way and your mental health be look after during the process then its perfectly fine to want that   
I go through this when I be in mania it be insatiable when I be not in mania I do not want to be touch one extreme to the other the abuse pa be most likely a fetish some people desire it nothing to be ashamed of this be an open group so I feel anything can be discuss and you should expect trigger what be the point of the page if you can not talk about the problem defeat the purpose pay no mind to anyone judge you we get that enough from society and should not have to worry about it here good luck
I understand that it may sound weird but I hope that be a real thing because I be a worrier and question everything while my bipolar diagnosis fit especially when I look at my behavior lead up to the diagnosis it also worry I that they be wrong and I be just a horny perve ya know so either way whether the hypersexuality due to bipolar or a sex addiction at least I would know I be not alone and that I can get help
interesting aicle now my question be can you have sex drive addiction and not be bipolar this be very real to I and I scare myself at time with the risky behavior
it actually affect my entire body when I do not get it I will have body spasm and cramp it kind of feel like a female version of blue ball with no way to relieve it I go into rage if my bf do not want to have sex and harm myself to try and get something out and even with sex it do not work all the time it feel nice but it do not relieve the achepressure no matter how many time we do it it seem to have get bad as I have age I be always either think about sex or death or a mixture of the two
wendy mcmaster I only copy what the person write     I have many fetish but want to be beat to the point of death would definitely qualify as abuse to I and that be something I struggle with lol
have not be diagnose bipolar yet but they be look at it I be like both of you and struggle to control it I do not have any sexually drive paner so it be just a lot of self care and sexual frustration
gosh I feel sooo uncomfoable talk to my doctor about this pa of it but it not just I    I go in wave and have hyper sexual time but the bad pa be I make bad decision when this happens   talk about it help and yes it be normal for we that have this as pa of our disorder   like it rough and want mark to be leave by your paner be something I enjoy look at after the fact when he be not around    rough but not abuse so perhaps she just misspoke of her desire
I love take risk though that be the problem I would not cheat as I adore my paner but the temptation be all to real
I do risky behavior when I be manic the goal be to have less manic episode but you got to find a medicine that wirk
change be uncomfoable even if it be for the good I have to learn that when stay hus more than leave then you be ready to go   even when you question yourself good luck to you
go you sound like you have plan and be sensible many people in abusive situation never leave or repeat the situation again and again you be become an adult and it seem as though you want to break the cycle be proud of yourself do not give in to doubt do not give in to fear your next step be the hard but you can do it we all have faith in you and wish you the very good live your life   your parent have choose theirs and their choice be not in your good interest live your life and make it wohwhile heck I do not even know you and I be proud of you for stand up for yourself and achieve what you have do and set yourself up for the next step   now lift that foot up and go
you be afraid because you grow up afraid    when parent put fear in their child they be scared to do anythingeven breathe   you also may be scared of hue they but if they be hue you you need to go    it be the first step in a new beginning   do what be good for you    you have to take care of yourself because nobody else will
sound to I like you have weigh your option and know what be good for you also you have a suppo system with your boss and friend and that be go to be key during this time do not listen to the feeling when you be alone and scare just remember that you be grow and you be change and you do not want the life you have live to happen again and you know in your hea of heas that if you stay it will get that way again go you have a life to lead and live I will be pray for you and I know with your suppo system you can make it
I leave my   abusive home life week before I be   I call the cop myself as I be leave to make sure I could legally leave and everything   however the adult involve do repo that I ranaway so we go to cou I bring my good friend who help I move and be victim to vial   threat make during the move and I bring the adult who be make sure I keep my act together   he have serve over sea twice    the judge hear both side then I swear to you he look at the adult I leave and laugh and tell they they be stupid and he tell I to go continue my new life   I also do not drive nor have a job   so do not let anyone tell you you that you deserve to be beat or mentaly or emotional   god forbid sexually abuse    it be scary and hard but you can do it
feel vulnerable at home be a common but unhealthy response to a toxic   abusive relationship take another suppoive adult   witness   with you loudly invite they into the house so family hear it do not whisper be bold explain that you be leave and take only your thing explain that you have discuss this with police and can call they to the house should it be necessary explain that you refrain from repoe the hit and can do so now if the need arise explain the jail time if you repo and press charge practice say all this numerous time in sho concise sentence then quickly grab your stuff and go no discussion have a business card for a point of contact with police   I be a firefighter and have do this for other before good of luck god bless
the comment I be see on here be horrific   I be go to repo some of these people to the admin   they already remove someone yesterday   you be scared because you be young and this be the life you be use to   but you be do the right thing for yourself   you have to make yourself   in this situation call selfpreservation   I have to do it too but I be much old than you be   yes it be scary but you be so sma and do all the right thing and you be lucky you have so many people in your corner   do not stay there it be not a healthy environment for you   keep move forward and hang in there
even if you mention she hit you without proof they would not have be able to do anything   I spend year in the exact same situation   when I get tired of it and take off my mom do repo I as a runaway to save face with the rest of the family   they end up help she get I back in her house   be prepare for anything be the only reason I tell you this   I hope thing go well and if you need encouragement and help there be peoplemake sure you know that when you be home and scare   even stranger like we be only a message away
those feeling be normal you be scared and feel alone those will pass I hope all go well for you
tip do not listen to your feeling when you be alone and scare sometimes we have to ignore our feeling and do what we know be good for us feeling can be soe through and resolve once we be safe and feel secure hang tough just go do not think just go

I be so sorry your have to go thru this you seem very mature for your age and have research and plan it well we be suppose to be able to rely on family but some case it just be not thstvway and you must look out for yourself and your own pyhsical and mental well being and do not feel guilty for that you deserve to be happy and if you have a plan then go for it all the law and stuff you billet you be very right my son run away at   and it be that way w the law however he run away because he be use drug and I be on a mission to keep he clean   there be so many good people in this world I hope you find one along your journey to help you good luck and lot of prayer redhea

I be really struggle with out med   I do sta see a new therapist
try not to put to much pressure on yourself     these dark time sometimes take a bit to get through     you will comeout the other side    baby step do not set huge goal work towards be g md if that be something you be able to do     you be strong
have your md check your thyroid include t and thyroid antibodie   do not let they just check tsh and t   autoimmune hypothyroidism be common in woman and also occur after give bih   it can cause depression and fatigue   also have you doc check for the mthfr mutation   if you have it you may need methylate bvitamin because you body can not use the normal one very well   b vitamin be impoant to the nervous system   google both these thing and decide for yourself
I have be on allergy shot when young then med since teen year along w a prescription asthma inhaler   mo ago after   round of antibiotic and   woh of otc drug I be still suffer I be desperate I try essential oil it be   mo later and I do not use med for anything my allergiesasthmaheadache be all control naturally witjout the side effect that med have   we be too quick to reach for quick fix instead of learn our body and be preventive
I try without med and end up in the mental health ward not a pretty place horrible staff and even bad food they take away your phone and you get fresh air   time a day the bed be horrible and you end up on more med than you go in with if you be lucky you see a psychiatrist once a week and no councilling please reconsider take med depression just do not go away it sit in the back of your mind like people say you can not snap out of it it take time med and suppo
lifestyle change can also work I wish soneone would have give I that option before fill I up w meds that cause so many side effect what we eat be sooooo impoant because food   turn to chenical and chenical be what control the mind I be also tell the only way to control my anxiety be medswrong exercise do way more than med do and without more side effect   yes I sgree sometine people need med to reboot but not for a perm solution
I be sorry you have such a bad experience mine be different staff be fantastic I go home on few med than I go in with they do not want we on phone so that we would be present in the healing process   it be a way to sever tie with outside stressor and provide a safe space the food be decent we have appointment with a nurse a social worker and a psychiatrist daily as well as group we wear street clothe not hospital gown lace and string in hoodie remove no belt or scarf but we do not get fresh air if anyone besides kalissa read this please know that experience differ by hospital and it may not be an awful experience each program be different I actually miss my time there
have a chat with your dr and a psychologist there be some fantastic self help treatment you can try that can really help sometimes in my case I use positive affirmation to change the negative nasty comment i d be think about myself and it feel wrong and uncomfoable at first but I make a conscious effo to always pay attention to the thought that be go through my head and everytime a negative one come i d stop myself and force myself to think something positive instead it take awhile but it definately help and my mind became use to think the positive thought rather than the negative smilingface
I agree take the med I try without and believe I it do not work I be very stubborn and it take quite a few year to realise my stupidity you be a well mam if you be a relaxed mam I end up be a single mam after my husband leave we my son be     I use to plan stuff to do all the time so he be never bore and we have a great time together make some very good memory by make plan it make you get on with it it be very difficult to pull yourself together and do it but by plan it give you time to psych yourself up I do not want to let my son down and that be what keep I go and believe I med give you the crutch to help there be no shame in need help so give it some thought and try to go for it x
the good advice I can give you be to always be honest with people about how you feel and what your thinking they be look out for your beat interest and will need to know what your need be on your bad day and your good   day   never be afraid to need help it be not a bother to ask question or seek advice
sorry for sound thick neil sandy but if you can not walk how do you answer the door you know I be a carer for my paner who have bipolar and I suffer with severe depression and on my bad day will not even get out of bed for day or feed we as I do all the cooking my paner can not cook and she be a danger to herself if she try to cook anything eg she put a tin of soup in the microwave to heat it I will not speak to anyone and so how would I be able to poray that my paner have no math skill and can not budget for anything I pay all the bill do the shopping in fact I do everything to be honest when that day arrive which be come soon I have buy my rope and will leave this life as the stress of all this be slowly kill I anyway to be plunge into debt because my esa and paner dla be stop I can not do this at all sorry if this have detract from original post really I be
I have pip on my mental status and be totally embarrassedyou have to poray yourself on your bad daythey come to check every pa of the form you fill in x
the most impoant thing be to poray yourself on your bad day so if you can not walk at all on those day then tomorrow you do not walk the people who come out be nice and will help you you only need   out of   point to get full mobility component   pip sound scary for some but it be actually more basic and for those who be disabled it will pay out
I be so glad people be finally understand this as it absolute truth and there be nothing to be ashamed of
there be other thing to worry about then small word     I have no problem with it and do not see why anyone would people make a fuss out of such little thing build a statue of the word bae and god know someone be go to get offend
that be literally how I feel most day I be struggle with medical issue as well and my self esteem be very low and my self confidence be low   I have so much self hate and hidden insecurity   I fight a daily inner battle   I fight every day not to kill myself although everything in I scream   just end it cuz no one would miss I cuz I be wohless stupid and ugly   I feel so hopeless and empty and alone lonley and break   deal with my intense depression and anxiety be a nightmare   the hu pain and sadness and sorrow and despair never go away but I hide my emotion so well most people would never know I be struggle so bad   I hide behind a mask   I fake so many smile and laugh   I be just tired I be pretend I be happy and ok
anxiety too
I internalize everything to avoid issue but in the end I end up hu
yupthat be meid crawl through broken glass to avoid conflict  
well this be take the word right out of my mouth   definitely describe I   story of my life   how I feel every day I be feel so much hu pain sadness sorrow and despair but I wear a mask so it be all hide   I pretend I be ok and I pretend I be strong but inside I be struggle and need help behind my fake smile and phony laughter and behind my sarcasm and    sass and attitude and anger I be fight an inner battle that no one see
I have a memory of the bathroom in the house I grow up in be white and freezing and I hate it so much I avoid use it at night it be actually blue they think I experience some trauma that I have repress then again the trauma could have be that it be on the windy side of the house so cold there be lot of reason for false memory but trauma be a biggie for they
I have just say it be day to day thing that I struggle with   I be not sure if it be the lamotragine memory issue or more than that but I can genuinely argue for or against whatever it be the person be say to I and it turn out I be completely wrong but I would be   sure I think I be right from my memory   it be really stae to upset I and sta question everything
be there an admin that can remove this brigitte person people here do not need to be attack for ask for help this be why so many people be afraid to speak up sad we all need to suppo one another
there be thing that have happen in my life which I be positive be memory but when I have ask other that be supposedly there they say no some of these false memory be so vivid that I be positive that I experience they but it be amazing what the mind can convince you of it make you question your memory on anything and everything it be horrible
be they real or be people tell you they be not real just ask because I know someone who think their memory be real and they be horrific I would never imagine anyone go through these situation and they be so real to this person they have find peace with god over the horrific situation however they still struggle daily
also do not make the mistake I do last month and quit during a panic attack
you be not alone I would stick it out if you can just have to educate s new co working group be s ton of stress in its self in my opinion no one be go to take it good heck most of our friend and family do not   
I be just scared because the nature of my job be fairly dangerous and I do not want they to come back and say I be not fit for the job I have be do the same thing at other company for   year and it be my passion I do not want to lose my job there be no other option in that industry I have go through they all
if people do stop med good to reduce slowly and make sure you be life be stable stress free
retake your medication the side affect of these tablet be horrible I accidently never take priadel lithium for a few day the pain thought and withdrawal be not nice I know it be the tablet and get through it with help from my family I be never stop priadel ever unless the doctor say
you need to relax stay away from stress   try a massage   exercise whatever help you I like lavender oil you can deal with a fair bit   do not panic bout if a relapse be come it prob be not but if serious symptom sta then get help ps quetiapine v good for help you relax sleep   sho term use x
yes it what be happen it will pass but the dream be bizare I have see myself in my own dream when I stop take risperdal I have dream that be scary and fuck up mean you should not see yourself fall on piece of glass as it go through your neck as you bleed out in front of the glass in front off you
I take myself off of my adhd med in   I can not take antidepressant or antianxiety med because I have severely bad side effect I live with depression and my anxiety attack chest pain and panic attack because I do not know any way of cope or what I can take for they I have try see a psychologist but talk about my problem only bring back the memory that bring this burden upon I in some way it seem that my depressed state drive people away from I to where they do not want to hang out or socialize with I which lead I to become more depressed and angry control my temper be very hard at time and I just can not help myself I have have thought of suicide but I do not have it in I to go through with it it would hu a lot of people but as I continue live I be the one with mental pain people act or seem like they do not care or miss I I be sure if I just up and die they would think a lot differently to the one who do not talk to I they may see I and say they recognize I but they will not know I for I will have change every day I feel like I be drift fuher away from people and with less contact I feel its not go to get any well
I get newsthey will not give you the med you need when you be preggothe most they be willing to go be a low dose of zoloft or prozacnobody in my town would give I medsno matter how much I beg and criedi have to be hospitalize several time during my pregnancy for suicidal thoughtsgave bih   month agolet I tell youit be the worstmost horrify pregnancy I have ever hadit be a never end nightmare I could not wake up out ofi would not wish that misery on my bad enemyi be warn youif you be anything like mehave be take med since a small childand can not live without themdo not do ityou are in for a hellish   month
that be a horrible experience I be fine with both my kid during pregnancy not medicate    I feel very great actuallybut it be the after bih that I have a hard time with my doctor be put I on med while I be pregnant so I do not go low or high
yes I would talk with your psychiatrist if you r want to have another one   we be work on one and I get all my med slowly taper off due to the risk
talk your psychiatrist there be medicine that be ok mine keep I on my serequel cuz the benefit outweigh the risk they just keep an eye on everything if you want another baby you go girl
I try it and I do not want to scare you or assume you be like I but I get pregnant a few year ago I have bipolar ii and generalized anxiety disorder there be some med you can take when you be pregnant but it be not the same and in my opinion may not be healthy for a baby I could not handle the pregnancy approve med they do nothing for I I become so suicidal that I know I might kill myself even pregnant I will be brutally honest I end up get an aboion I will never get pregnant again it be not safe for I or the baby I be not judge what you feel be right that be just my story and how hard that be on I on every level
I would advise a reasonable gap between kid to make thing easy two small kid at home would be v stressful care plan much well these day an epidural help I a lot to avoid stress pain which be a trigger for I you need to organise help after the baby ie at night if breastfeed interfere with medication then do not do it I have quetiapine which help I relax after bih and sleep which be v impoant you be case may be different as long as you know you be trigger   pattern but it be manageable so do not worry I be v high risk and this work along with prayer   
if you do not feel ready you should not feel pressure into get pregnant again he should not expect you to either
I be also bipolar   severe depression anxiety also have tourette syndrome I be currently off medication to try and sta a family it be no walk in the park you have to take everything min by min but   I be hope it will be for the good I hope all work out

hello I have be where you be I be   and be not diagnose until I be   with bipolar   anxiety and borderline I can tell you it cause a lot of issue for I relationship wise and I wish I would of have someone back then to help I before I be place on my med I be pretty unstable   anger   mood all over the place and very impulsive it even lead I into some legal issue the downward spiral you be have right now be due to not be able to process the emotion at the moment correctly and that be because you be inconsistent with your med your bf threat to leave be a understandable reason for this spiral but speak from having be thru a similar thing before its because he want to see you mentally healthy if you two have be together over   year I be sure he have see you at your good and your bad my suggestion to you be to look into if you have a stabilization center near you I have have to do it a couple time in the past you can check yourself in as a walk in   average stay be   day if you truly want to help yourself then become stable should be your priority and once you do this you will see the talk from he of leave be just his way of try to get you to realize you need the help
I have all those same prob n I havemt take a pill in yrs my husband know I have good n bad day but he still suppos I in whatever I have to deal with if you do not like pill go natural there be ton of herb n tincture you can use I manage to find a few thing that help without the med its trial n error sta small and try different thing till you find something that ease most of you be symptom its you be personal choiceyou be life if you do not want to take med then do not but do not let you are bf pressure you into takin they jst cu half the med they give you for this crap be ssris I recommend do some research as for the rest of you people that keep tell she to take her med fck you its her fckin choice uf she want to take they or not you do not need pharmaceutical to combat mental illness there be many other option she can use
let he go its not woh more stress in your life I no its hard but with time we move on
try to eliminate some of the med that be not do anything for you and keep take the med that do it can take quite a while to find which one be right for you and what the minimum dose be that be effective be pressure will not leave you in a position to reduce any of your med be misunderstood will make you feel bad I have have to accept that I have to take my tablet I have try to stop take they before and land up be much bad than what I begin work with your doctor or mental health clinic to establish which one or two tablet may be balance the chemical in your brain sometimes the onset be trigger by ceain person in your life but even if you stay away from they you may need less med but the imbalance will still be there albeit to a less degree people who do not understand sometimes be deny their own shocoming concern their mental health good luck
please take your med you need they it be nothing to be ashamed about I have come to accept that I will need to be on med for the rest of my life I have bipolar ii and depression I could not function without my med
there be an imbalace you need your med if you be have adverse side effect tell your doc if you be take they irregularly you be still not get that balance you need mental illness be not easy and its so hard to force yourself to take your med and no they be not a cure all its not like they be magically go to make everything well but theybwill help you jave a more focused valuable life understand non mentally ill people do not know our struggle we be give they a war listen to their need as well as your but always take care of yourself
personally I think it be irresponsible to not take med if your doctor give they to you   what happen to grown up self disciple   I take mine if not for I then for the people who have to deal with I   it be not fair to they for I to refuse my med and then expect they to understand when I have   bad day or I be act up or in depressive slump   I love the people in my life and would rather spare they the hardship of live with I unnecessarily because I choose not to swallow a few pill   I have ptsd   chronic depression social anxiety disorder and bipolar
it be funny how the mentally ill be on the front line so to speak to battle the stigma of mental illness be not it your comment resonate with I in that sense it be definitely a hard struggle to say the least but we must keep on fighting every day
as a bipolar with anxiety and ptsd take your med talk to your doc if you want to cut some out or see if there be something out there that can take their place
I be in the belief he have take to strong word because he be worried and do not know how to express feeling of lose you too the demon that medication keep away hope and prayer with you
I hate med myself and would prefer more natural method however I have come to realize that not every illness can be manage this way and I need to take pharmaceutical some med be necessary in order for we to have even a small quality of life in our day even if we do not want to take they or do not think they help if you do not think they be help though I would definitely consult with your doctor and pharmacist as well about possibly change they up remember though any change of med come with an adjustment phase that can sometimes be rough   I know you be worried about your paner but you need to be a bit selfish and focus on you it be very hard to know how much you be deal with when you be stress or focus on the concern of other
everyone hate I as well as I really really hate myself deal with bpd depression ptsd anxiety really bad flash back make it bad it much more then hate

bipolardepressionanxiety open page yeah smaphone be a contradiction case in point I have get an ongoing battle with mine over its need to change the word when to she for absolutely no good reason I think a lot of the text style with the lack of proper word and the need to use letter and number have more to do with age than anything else while I do know some people in my age group that do the letter and number the vast majority of they text the way they be teach to write in school
I usually try use proper spelling and grammar I be far from perfect but even when texte I use sentence and never use you     etc some friend poke fun at I for it but I just find it easy to understand sometimes I get so confused with all the lingo dani

yes I have lot of negative thought and suicidal thought but it seem lot of people   on here be not understand or suppoive so it be a little upsetting especially since I be really need help and suppo   yes suicide be a very real thing thing for I
what you be crazy not in literal term I have speak with a lot of nice people who share my struggle and if they do not they be generous to talk to you and if you feel like no one listen to you I be here smilingface

this whole conversation be disturb
I think a lot of we or ju myself do not talk about exactly what I think because I be scared of judgement my thought scare and disgust I my thought make I feel evil like I be not human anymore   
I talk to my gp about my dark thought and she could not handle they freak put and demand to have I admit a psychiatrist have to educate she on what thought be and how to determine the real risk embarrass for she I do not see she any more
every damned day the thing be even though I have mental ill health I be generally a happy person and I try to show it on the outside so only a few people know what go on inside my head if people know the true extent of what go on they would be genuinely worried and possibly quite scared so I do not let people know most of the stuff I think many other be in the same boat as well which be quite sad
I be while on risperidone quite disturbing thought they have pretty much go away since switch to seroquel
sadly I do it get quite scary sometimes
every single day it scare the shit out of I that I could even muster up such dark thought
jules letellier yes be mindful of my thought I have a bad habit of live in yesterday which do not help my depression live in tomorrow which do not help my anxiety my mind roam to the dark place and I get very consumed thinking about thing that be happen in the world and I feel all those emotion that other be probably feel as this devastation be take place I feel empathy and sympathy for all the human and animal that be out there right now suffer and be abuse and I can get stick there and it feel awful not so much accept the thought but redirect they to something healthy that do not make I feel so horrible like say to myself if these thought be not go to help or change thing then I need to redirect my thought to more positive one it be a very hard process but I do have a wonderful therapist and I do not know where I would be without her small step   
yes I agree it be scary that we could have such intense and morbidly dark thought in our mind but I deal with these thought daily   it be a struggle
this be disturbing and should be take down
disturb how about this open a dialogue for those who want and need to talkplease educate your self or you will be offend by someone with diabete next ignorance before investigation always get I in troublehave a blessed day
want to explain why this be disturb
how be this disturb explain   
rightwe should all keep hide in the dark and feel ashamed of our own thoughtsgo away
yes this   be so I I have be struggle since I be thieen year old I be now
I be in the houston tx area where we have hurricane     harvey I talk to my drs office yesterday before they close at noon because one of med     I do not have enough to get I through this mess because it be a free clinic that be where I also get my med from their pharmacy but the pharmacy be already close so there be no access until this hurricane     be over and that could be for day I be in this apt with a disabled vet who also have ptsd we have have some interesting time of his ptsd mix with my bipolar anxiety bpd and ptsd mostly we be able to laugh     and joke     but if you could please keep we in your prayer I be a little nutty       right now
every day be a struggle for I and it be hard but I would let it win this time this biche be not go down with out a fight it can grow leg and piss off
I struggle all the time   
you will never trust he again every time his phone bleep or he be slightly late you will feel bad   and already suffer with anxiety do you feel you can handle it   z
the two of you be separate so technically he do not cheat that be the one thing he have in his favor but he must not have very much respect for you let alone love if he could go out and sleep with someone else know the effect it would have on you my husband actually do cheat on I then he come home and throw it in my face because he know it would be the one thing that would hu I the most and to make matter even worse he have the affair on new year which mean not only will I always remember the exact day it happen but I will sta each new year angry hu and resentful yeah fun for I I can tell you from experience that it do get easy to live with eventually you will reach a point where it be not the very first thing you think about when you wake up in the morning you will always have that brick in your chest where your hea use to be but since it be always there you will get use to it and will not notice it so much anymore but there will always be those impossibletoanswer question that will because you to lose sleep at night   do he really love I   how could he do this to I why she   do he have feeling for she   will he do it again   be I an idiot for take he back   do the fact that I do make I weak be she well than I   those question will drive you insane at night I understand how you feel like you I love my husband more than anything too and it be hard to get past a betrayal of that magnitude founately my husband do not get his squeeze toy pregnant so I do not have to worry about she be in my face for the rest of my life and I can not even begin to imagine how that must feel I honestly do not think I could have handle it so he probably would have be go under those circumstance it just depend on you and how you feel ask yourself which be strong your love for he or the resentment you feel toward he you may not have reach the resentful stage yet but trust I you will and keep in mind that man be very physical creature shocker whereas as woman be very emotional for they sex be not always just about pleasure it be something they often reso to in time of stress anger sadness and loneliness because their brain be not wire to express emotion like women be for man sex be often use as an outlet so it could be that he be miss you and just use she to make himself feel well a lot of woman out there be read that last pa go umm no lol which be a really shitty thing to do in my opinion but everyone handle thing differently I suppose keep in mind that I be in no way justify what either of our husband do man might not be as emotionally complicated as woman but they know right from wrong and have the ability to control their action just like anyone else but if you love your husband half as much as I love mine you will not leave he no matter how many people advise you to so I be just try to help you look at it a different way to give you some peace of mind and hopefully make it a little easy on you you will probably always love he regardless but your feeling for he will never be the same after this so you just have to ask yourself if you be prepared to live with that but you be not weak or stupid if you choose to stay not that anyone imply that but that be how I spend a lot of time feel when my husband do what he do I would say to myself how could I possibly take he back after that I must be crazy normal people do not stay with someone who cheat on they they leave I must be the weak stupid person on the planet but after a while I realize it be the complete opposite it take a strong person to stay and get past something like that cuz it hus bad than just about anything I would rather have both my leg cut out from underneath I than ever feel like that again I hope something I say make you feel a little well cuz I know what that kind of heaache feel like and I would not wish it on my bad enemy it will get easy I promise but your feeling will never be the same
she tell he she be on bih control and be message I tell I he already file for divorce she be taunt I and make it a point to let I know that they be go to spend the rest of their life together she even send I a picture of ring they be look at I myself suffer from depression anxiety ptsd so all this be really take a toll on I thank you guy for be suppoive and understanding as well
you talk far more sense than some other on here they all talk about betrayal and he have an affair not one person have even consider what he be go through at the time it be not only the person suffer from depression and anxiety that be suffer but also the paner hence the separation   at the end of the day he be go through a bad time too do a stupid thing n it unfounately result in a pregnancy   if you can not get past that n suppo each other through this then it will not work   the other lady do not ask for all this so just try hard to make it work together n not to fight
I be bipolar I have be on wellbutrin for year when I first stae on it it do not come in extend release I would have break thru anxiety attack    the extend release version do not seem to cause this problem and have put my depression on hold
I have bipolar disorder the first several month be really good but it gradually make I more and more anxious to a point I could barely function I think it be good for a lot of people but it be also know to throw you into a mania and increase anxiety
I be on it I still have panic attack bad about drive and crowd I now can not sleep since my dose be increase but I be no long depressed
I be on   mg twice a day and   mg of cexela and I be still struggle no side affect though
wellbutrin be the first antidepressant to work for I so I love it just be careful of some of the side effect it can cause sleep disruption anxiety weightloss then weight gain
I have work up to   mg daily for about a year now it help stabilize my depression and anxiety it keep I off of cigarette I love it but result may vary blah blah blah
I have depressionanxietyptsd and have be on it for a couple year and its work pretty good
it be help I with the depression of my bipolar but give I terrible headache and do nothing for my anxiety
if you be bipolar you may want to discuss whether or not wellbutrin be right for your condition as it can cause mania   since this page be also devoted to people with depression and anxiety as well I can speak from experience as I do not have bipolar but I do have depression   anxiety   wellbutrin put my depression on hold entirely   my pervasive thought loop shut down so I can think more clearly   my attention be well and so be my ability to concentrate   I have also lose about   pound but I need to lose weight    bad pas     it make I jittery and a little twitchy   I find myself to be more physically restless so I move around a lot more than I use to     it wear off for I late in the evening as I take it when I first get up in the morning and my depression can sta to rear its head again in the late evening   I usually try to offset that by go to bed    some people also say that wellbutrin can exacerbate anxiety   I can not really tell since my anxiety be so bad anyway that I doubt I would notice if it be make a tiny bit bad   it would have to make I much bad in order for I to notice but it can for some people because increase anxiety if you have any side effect that be bothersome or that make you feel bad I be sure you already know to return to your doctor and get the medication switch   I love wellbutrin as it be work well for I   I wish you only the good of luck with your new medication
it be terrible for I cause I to be very irritable at the time I be on it a few year ago I have be misdiagnose with bipolar I quickly take myself off of it year later this year turn out I actually have bpd major depression anxiety   I be on paxil and xanax now and it be help wonder just keep in mind different medicine react differently with each individual
it will help you quit smoking but it be terrible for anxiety or bpd
absolutely   separation from a paner can become a common trigger for anxiety or panic attack   your mind may ruminate over bad thought they may be your main suppo you may worry about they   med adjustment and cbt can help   just stick with it
I have bipolar disorder ptsd and add I have horrible depression and they try everything under the sun but just keep go down the list zoloft work then quit so do cymbalta so down the list we continue now I be on paxil abilify which be a godsend lithium lamictal ativan for anxiety with baclofen adderral for energy and I be finally pretty stable
in general it be not use even in bipolar they try not to use it if they can avoid it because of the way it can beat the kidney up she do not say lithium someone in the response do not sure if it be you or not I be happy it work for you it be a battle a lot of the time find what work for each of we I be speak in overall general term
you can see it with I I sta to shake a little and nervous also sta sweat
serroquil be bad I rather do tylenol pm I take hydroxyzine and it do not help I when I have panic attack however I take it early in the morning when I knw work be go to be tuff alprazolam be the only thing that control my panic attack
I take seroquel at bedtime sleep but feel like cap during the day exhaust and irritable to no end take year but finally find a combo that work well for I keep look and stay on top of your doctor you deserve to feel good night and day
you can have they in mg for daytimethat be what I usebut cannabis be way well for anxietyreally kill it for melife changerbit heavy to be on seroquell
the hydrogen be a blood pressure med I do not agree put people on they they put I on   different one one night my blood pressure be so low I just drop to the floor have to call ambulance go to emergency room I jack my knee up so bad they hu for   month you will get more relief from the seroqul than the other I take small dose all throw the day it help take anything they offer but high blood pressure med they be mess with something they have no business do
after   plus year of try this or that cymbalta work for I and the good thing about it be that it take about   day to sta work I be so thankful to have find this medicine its unbelievable for I I be now use cbd oil hempworx it be work wonder on my ache pain and anxiety but my depression not so much yeti have faith   if anyone want info on cbd oil shoot I a message thanksvonda
maybe a trial of buspar it be specifically for anxiety but will take a couple of week to take effect   have help I a great deal
buspar be a very light anxiety me it sound like you need something different talk to your dr
sometimes it take lot of med change to find the right combination stick with it eventually you will find a combo that work but it do sound like you may need ativan klonopin valium or xanax for the anxiety itselfbest of luck to youhang in there
find the right med and dosage be a trial and error that everyone have to go through it can be hard and this be the phase where people sometimes give up and swear off med all together do not give up you will find the right one that work for you please keep try you be on the right track   your doctor may need to perscribe a seperate anxiety medication definantly keep in contact with your doctor over the issue and keep try thing out the only real thing I can recomend from expirence be it often take at least   week on any medication to see a diffrence unless the side effect be dibilitate please try and give it   week before decide thing be not work and move on
ah ok we do not have access to music cord can be use for asphyxiation I miss have a suppo system after I get out I have to fend for myself again   in the hospital I just show up to meal I miss have people that get it   we would be genuine in our laughter about our inappropriate joke about where we be have very frank discussion about what bring we there etc I do not have to hide anything   everything be on the table out in the open suicide attempt mania hearing voice sex addiction drug abuse thing that be taboo in normal society be normal for we and I still miss that I miss be able to be myself even if it be depressed and scared and ashamed I never put on good grace there I miss be safe it take I about   week before I feel comfoable be on the outside talk to people and I still be not completely assimilate I definitely have to put on the happy face and say that I be do ok even though I definitely be not   one week in a hospital do not cure you it just give you a safe place to sta to heal I dread go out to the mall I just do not go grocery shopping have to do it run into friend have not hear from you in a while that be because I be in a psych wardi physically feel like I need to duck to avoidsomethe I be off work for   week and it would have be long but I teach and it be the end of the year and all anyone know be that I be sick my staff be terrific and only   people know where I be   it be the good keep secret ever in that building   people out of   I will never be able to repay that debt but get back into the regular world be hard it take time but it do not happen for I   day be just scratch the surface of my return into society
I understand it make you feel crappy but you should not stop take it a lot of medication can have negative side effect but after take they for a couple week and they get in your system and your body adjust the side effect will go away but now since you have stop they you will not know if they be go to help you or not one of the med I be on actually I have horrible side effect when I stae they I be have nightmare I be throw up just think about food and I even piss the bed   night in a row I tell my doctor about it right away and say I can not handle this he tell I to please take they for   week   after   week and   day those side effect stae slow down and after   week I have not have any side effect at all they all go away completely I have be on this med for   month now and it be by far the good medication that I have ever be on in the past   year just my advice a little food for thought dani
nope I will not be ashamed of my emotion
I understand how you feel I have my high   low while on mg zoloft pluse   mg valium and neulactil   a day   any emotional event can cause have low I have trouble get out bed as I feel when you be sleep you feel no emotion I use to smoke a bit of canabis to help I stay calm but have hea attack caiac arrest     stop   canabi so I find I struggle more without it I be in process get my med change due to weight gain I be dread it cos I do not cope at all   I hope you sta feel well soon just talk to you be dr about you be medication it might need to be increase   x
have a mental illness mean sometimes dosage need to be adjust or medication need to be change   my exwife struggle for year until she find the right medication and dosage first it be lithium then topamax finally depakote work the good medication for depression and anxiety be somewhat the same you have to get the medication that work well and the correct dosage   for my anxiety clonzapam be the right medication from the sta but depression medication be an on go challenge   first it be pristiq then lexapro   cymbalta amatriptyline and countless other   to date I be still search for the right medication   sometimes these take time but do not give up hope   you will get it right and you will know it   my exwife know she be on the right medication without anyone tell she so
one thing that people forget to mention be god it be not about be religious but about be spiritual and that mean believe in something positive and good there have to have be something that trigger those feeling of depression back and its hard to distinguish what it be I personally feel get those horrible feeling all of a sudden that I immediately react in a way that be unforgivable to my love one I beg god to make I a different and well normal human being because I do not even like myselfmy outburst and it be be month since I have take my med   and I think that I would of already be in the mental ward by now but thank god that he have allow I to still be here with my family do the good that I can to manage it   so what I have also do be I beg my husband to educate himself on bipolar and all the rest of the disorder do to a person so that he could learn how to cope and so he could help I manage it because all the medicine I have be take all these year be only numb I and I be pretty sure not help my liver nor kidney   basically what I be say be that in order for I to cope with it I need faith in god ny high powehe suppo of my family they learn about the disorder so it could show they how to help I manage it and of course for they to also cope in a positive way because if not they would have already leave I and I would not know what to do with myself I have be learn something new every day and it do not matter how old or young it be always good to educate ourselves on any kind of disorder disease or addiction for the sake of the one we love   positive suppo from family   friend ask for help   learn technic on how to control the situation   thought that trigger our bipolar mood swing   ect and keep ourselves active to improve our health help control manage or not think about those horrible negative feeling from get bad and so foh   but eventually I believe if we follow some of the good positive advise give will do we bipolar people some time and you will see some improvement and it do take time   and the surrounding have a lot to do with it
I have horrible reaction with all the other med lithium be my lifeline I make sure to drink plenty of fluid and doc keep a close eye on toxicity and kidney and liver function basically try to say different med work differently for different people
lithium be an old medication and I be surprise by how many people be on it lithium be very hard on the kidney sorry for your loss and the horrible way it go it be a shocker epilim be also a mood stabilis like lithium and cause zero damage to the kidney and no side effect to I I strongly suggest that you give epilim a go bipolar people tend to need medication to help they manage it when I try a vitimin therapy that do not work I bounce from one disaster to the next
hey sweetie we have all be where you be do not just suffer I have have bipolar my entire life the med change be an uncomfoable roller coaster but it be woh it you will feel well so go to your dr and feel well soon hug   prayer
nope you be not the only one I have have to do this quite often over the last   of have this illness and those that say med do not cure be right learn your trigger and develop cope skill be all you can do med do not stop bipolardepression and anxiety altogether they help control it to be able to survivelive with it   I also remember this shall too pass I personally I spend a lot of time in prayer try to refocus myself also you might have to try new med every couple to few year I have too the one I may be on just stop work it suck but I have always find a new med path I hate adjust to or try to find new med just know you be not alone and treat yourself kindly
manic panic schizophrenic  
I have struggle with my weight for year and I be not even five foot   it be so depressing I be feed up with be overweight   it be hard   be difficult on my self esteem and self image
jess n kailey   I agree with you jess how can other understand a depression that be cause by a chemical imbalance if they have not experience it themselves they do not which only add to the stigma and it do not help either   in addition to be depress you should also feel guilty about it put oneself out there one will get all kind of response    try to rule out the one that only bring you down and look for those who show actual understanding
have a good well respected gp be key to get on disability there be always a medication that can help so do not give up try even though it can take a while to find the right combo marijuana be good for everything but I can not get it for ptsd an alpha blocker like prazosin help with nightmare not many gps know this a betta blocker like propranolol be good if you have panic attack shake or hea pulpitation other than that anti depressant and a mild antipsychotic do help with anxiety and sleep
be you open and able to try marijuana if not an antidepressant and mood stabilizer with something for anxiety should help I use they all and combine it change my life and the marijuana alone almost instantly help bring I out of whatever I be feel and go through you would be surprise my opinion though
I be scared of take med too but then as a last reso I do and they save my life just know you be not alone in your feeling
go on to google and try echo tap or binaural meditation really help my anxietyif I have no med I can not function and that scare metry and stay focus when your zoning out concentrate on one thing in the room till it pass and do your breathing exercise I find a new one that I likebreathe in for   hold your breath for   and then breath out for   as many cycle as you canconcentrate on countinghope you feel calm soon chic x x
I would advise you to seek professional help do not be afraid of med they can help you live a more normal life I have accept that I will be on med the rest of my life to manage my bipolar ii and the depression good luck to you  
sorry but l disagree l be hit with crippling anxiety very similar to you l be a strong person I take anti depressant in combination with therapy on the nhs and two year later l be far well medication be sometimes the answer
when thing get bad I write every thought downno matter how cluttered or irrational   get it all out really help   sometimes I will write more than   page in my journal   one sentence after another   not think about what I be write but write what I be think   I end up finally have the confidence of read some to my shrink so she would understand how my head be work during issue   after about   month I staed be able to cope a lit well because I be not hold anything in anymore which make it possible to process and move forward

I have drive anxiety cuhz my sibling be kill by automobile incident and not know what other driver be go to do or how they drive really get my nervous however I smoke weed for my anxiety I do not smoke enough to get high just enough to calm my nerve and I never smoke indica before drive I stop take pharmaceutical year ago because they only help if I be take super high and unsafe dose
I also suffer from panic attack and anxiety attack I highly recommend you try cbd oil it do wonder for I and its all natural
I have anxiety depression and ptsd I can no long drive and can barely be a passenger it be awful
I get panic attack while drive some time if its a place I drive to a lot I know place I can pull over to calm myself down try some type of distraction music
I be on all those pill plus some I have bi polar anxiety depression and insomnia my bf hate I so I quit they all at once now I eat vegan and excersise I do love my alcohol and essential oil the pill be not good in my opinion
I take klonopin and abilify for year and have no business drive on they I gain   lbs and look back on that as a very overmedicated dark unnecessary period in my life I rarely put down anyone medical treatment as I be not their doctor but I be tell you my experience and this fact it have be discover that adderall and meth be chemically essentially the same thing I would be very scared to meet someone on all the med your on and adderall
I would be sleep with all that but seriously not judge I have anxiety drive however I know how my medication affect I so if I feel impaired at all I would not risk other people safety
I give up drive a decade or so ago because the panic attack I be have drive be out of control   within a month of sell my truck the panic attack pretty much stop   I go from hundred a month to a couple a year   it mean a major life change but at least I be not afraid I be go to kill somebody while panic behind the wheel of a car
I be agoraphobic for   year could go anywhere in a car I would have to pull over and get out of the car due to anxiety attack I too have gad   bipolar depression and suffer from ptsd I   currently on prozac trazadone and bupropion it be a long story but   I have to get to a point   after suffer for   year that I be not go to live my life like that anymore no medicine help I with my anxiety attack I only become addicted to they even though they do not work   yrs ago   I drive from long beach here to moreno valley by myself I have not drive in over   year
I be able to drive fine on klonopin it lower my anxiety enough so that I be able to actually function   it be all on how you respond to the medication
I be do not like seroquel my daughter be on it I be on latuda work great well than other every person be different and dose be not always easy to find I take mg of diazepam for my anxiety I be on ton of med because I also have ra crohne diveiculitis depression migraine so it just keep get bad
I take gabapentin mainly for bi polar and help bone spur in my back that be a plus I would change your time on kolonopin deffinatly can get you a dui if you have to go somewhere take it when you get back if it have a strong effect I take seroquel throw out the day do not effect anything because my anxiety be so high
mg of seroquel leave alone be enough for you to avoid drivingdamn
who can I talk to that I can discuss option with to treat my severe anxiety and   severe depression do I need to be refer by a primary care physician to see any specialist
I take citalopram   mg no problem with drive I find it helpful if you have something to drink with you just in case a panic attack stasit work for I anyways
I have severe anxiety while drive I have take severe panic attack in the middle of big highway I have learn when I can and can not drive because of anxiety I use to take lorazapam for anxiety and would take it about   minute before leave the home it help greatly and never feel that I be under the influence or drug in any way I feel like any other person drive on the road then I get pregnant and I decide to try to not use any med for as long as the anxiety would let I it have be about   year or so now anyways I deff think there be ceain med that can help you that be okay to drive while take they as long as you be use to they and know how it will affect you
I think it depend on your history with drive if you get in a bad accident you may have ptsd due to it which case therapy would be a good remedy if you be a new driver it be normal to feel anxious I do not know if people have medication just for drive
I be   and still have a learner permit because I be terrify of drive I get so anxious that I get tunnel vision rapid hea beat and I can not keep thought straight I be on pill for anxiety and depression but it do nothing when it come to car I be on lamictal abilify hydroxyzine propanalol
it seem many different med be be throw out there to you for fohought with all their reactionssideeffect all over the place from person to person I do know every drug work different for each of we so I would think take someone else reaction to possible med or even med combo can lead to trouble if you be see they as how you would or would not react to they yourself I want to believe this reality many moon ago I have be diagnose with this disease for   year and have take many different med in many different combo remember a med can react one way with you and a whole other way with you depend on the other med take with it or just because your you for instance I have take hydroxyzine with previous med other than the one I be on now and tolerate it fully it help but now if I be to well it floor I so tired you ask what other take for anxiety attack I do take klonipin   mg for severe anxiety I take the dissolvable kind where they melt on my tongue and act instantly without this med I would be a basket case of anxiety as for I I do not linger away from docs direction for a second like take one more or even not take one at all this be dangerous stay within my guideline I function normal I could not do gabatine and many other they just do not touch mejust know you be not alone but that not one of we be alike with the med that work for they thus the reason these illness be so hard to get a hold of yet even cure good luck
the way I have learn to deal with my anxiety on the road be a little unohodox I use a fidget spinner it occupy just enough of my attention to ignore most of the annoyance
I take buspar x a day every day and then I have ativan   per day as need at mg per pill I be also on   other med also since I can not go out in public with out have a panic attack
I use to have full blow panic attack any time I have to drive long distance and have to pull over and go into a gas station bathroom for   min or more just to calm down   I finally get klonopin I take once a day or twice if need and I do okay I   would still rather not drive and be a passenger and have my tablet to keep I occupy on long trip
this sound like I minus the klonopin when the anxiety be bad and I try to drive like an hour away I will panic and need to turn around and go home for a while
I do not drive for several year due to panic attack a wise psychiatrist put I in trofonil and it change my life
I also have drive anxiety to the point where I have to pull over and throw up I do not take anything though I be on three antidepressant and that be enough
antidepressant will not help with anxiety unfounately
whenever someone tell I they get off med and change their diet use essential oil and exercise first I wonder be you bipolar because if you be you be manic and get help sick people never know they be sick until it be too late the psychosis anxiety suicidal ideation and general delusion I deal with when I be truly sick and everyone see but I think I be fine be truly life threaten I think everyone else be nut think something be wrong with I bipolar episode be no joke chemical imbalance get fix with chemical there be a little science for you
mess with bipolar medication be a very serious thing anxiety may be a symptom from the bipolar   however no one should recommend anyone to get off medication that be not a doctor   for some people it be a crisis without their medication because it be a legitimate chemical imbalance   mental illness be not anything new gmo gluten etc chemical this and that be not around in the bible day so please keep your natural remedy to yourself unless you go to medical school
this attitude valerie be one that really upset I do not you think those of we multiple medication to feel bad enough already
valerie wencka I do not disagree with your opinion but how you speak it   I be personally wean off med with the help of an amazing husband change in diet and therapy I still have sleep med and anxiety med both on an as need basis I be also stae college on monday so that may change
valerie wencka   do you even know what it be to have anxiety some people be bad than other and require medication not all holistic stuff work I have bad anxiety and take mg of celexa and mg of klonopin daily the klonopin do not make I sleepy though do not see why you can not drive
yes let we all stop take our med and instead go to whole food smh it must be all that gluten that cause anxiety maybe gmos and high fructose corn syrup too
that be the main poion of my anxiety   I use to love drive   it be one of my favorite thing to do and I insist on be the one to drive any time my family or friend go somewhere with I   the last year I be suddenly afflict with severe drive anxiety to the point that I have anxiety attack just think about drive   my doctor put I on klonopin and gabapentin day for anxiety but it do not really help my drive anxiety   like you I can not take klonopin before drive as it make I super sleepy     I know this probably do not help you much sadly   I do not have any real answer   I just want you to know that you be not alone   hug
if you know the anxiety   come with drive maybe talk to your therapist they know how to deal with it when you can pinpoint a ceain phobia
I have severe drive anxiety as well I take only buspirone for anxiety and so far it have not touch it at least I know I be not the only one out there with drive anxiety
I also have anxiety end up lay in the floor at work for   min   last night because of it that be before I go home   hour early to take my medicine that I usually don tell need to bring with I I only take my anxiety med as need not daily it be a really bad night delusional obsessive thought be what cause my anxiety last night    I take hydroxyzine it say it may cause drowsiness to use care when operate a vehicle I have never have any problem as far as be drowsy when I take it
I do occasionally when I know I be go to be somewhere I could end up have an anxiety attack I take   I live in a rural area so I have to drive pretty much everywhere like I say I have never have any issue but everyone react differently
have your primary care or gyn do a hormone test check your thyroid and other possibly unrelated thing that could be exacerbate your diagnosis especially during your time of the month that be probably a good sta not always be it just a mental health issue and if there be any even the slight increase of stress in your life can cause significant change keep a journal and document it all and see if you can not pick up over the course of month what your pattern look like and then take it to the doctor and let they help figure it out and the wrong medication could be do you bad than good have you try alternative therapy and treatment if you be bipolar I suggest an antidepressant and mood stabilizer and something for the anxiety attack and I really suggest try marijuana for all of it your life will see the change positively if your open to try something different I can not express it enough even with it be illegal in most state the statistic do not lie about its ability to effect the nervous system in a calming manner my opinion though
this be just what happen to I I get frustrate with the pms it be so sevi would really set off depression mood swing offten I be bad they give I a iud calm everything down I be also bi polar anxiety adhd I take lamotragine have help I do not feel my good till they treat the adhd that can cripple your life depend on how bad leave un treat
I be on this medicine for year and it never get any well I be on   mg twice a day on top of xanex   time a day and ambian at night when my diagnosis be change to bpd from bipolar along with sever depression ptsd sever anxiety disorder   panic disorder I have be on different med for bpd the withdrawal from lamotrigine be tough so if you do decide to change med make sure to decrease slowly
do you ask your doctor if it be a possibility that you may have borderline personality disorder with your mood swing be what they be because I find when I be diagnose with bipolar and they put I on medicine for it it do not totally work I also be diagnose with add anxiety ptsd I have now be tell by my current psychiatrist that he think my diagnosis should be or add to of borderline personality disorder and suggest that I use dbt skill to help with my mood stabilization maybe this type of therapy can help you too
dbt be dialectical behavioral therapy it help people that have a hard time regulate their mood and emotion often have feeling of abandonment suicidal thought or idea longterm depression anxiety karma ptsd feeling like your life be just exist it be a ceain set of skill that you learn several different one to help change these thought to more positive way I be sure if you google borderline personality disorder or dbt it can explain it well than I can
be you girl see gynocologist you may have hormonal disorder I have same problem be diagnose with polysistic disorder although I be also bp with panic anxiety kind of sound like it coincide
nikki shamell     
even though I have have professional tell I I be a very strong person I still consider myself weak when I be smile I be usually pretend because I do not want to make other uncomfoable I have miss too many event in my family live to count because I could not put that pretend smile on my big regret be not be in my nephews life I do cry in private at time but for the most pa the tear will not come and I internalize my hu I fight many battle that I keep to myself
    I do not get a licence until I be   I be almost   and   can only drive in town limit on side road without panic attack   so I have route I take to get where I need to go at ceain time when I know traffic be minimal   aka   agoraphobia    by the way population here be around   town be literally like mine long max   I have only drive on the highway twice since I staed drive to test the amount of anxiety and panic I get from the fast motion movement also   not medicate besides as need clonopin because my body reverse medication like magic   passenger   be twice as bad for I I usually always end up with a panic attack
they have change my lifeinitially I think they make I feel flat but then realise they have stop all th background anxiety and my brain be quietthey also stabilise my mood swing x
I be on setraline it take a while to kick in but its the good thing I ever do I have bipolar disorder type two and anxiety disorder setraline be the good thing whatever you do do not stop it even on day when you feel good I take mine at night it help alot x
be on mg due to depression which be pretty much under control now and severe social anxiety for I it dampen the anxiety down far enough that I can function I still get anxious especially out in crowd but it do not affect I as much as it use to before I go on medication
its also an antidepressant I be on it for almost year for depression anxiety and ocd I think it be great until I forget to take it if I miss a day I be all over the place and would be mentally screw for the day I be even at the point where I selfharme which be definitely not I   everyone be different though
personally for low mood and anxiety I would want to be on fluoxetine prozac
I be in no way an expe but I think maybe you should have your dr put you on some   new drug to try I be bipolar   ptsd social anxiety disorderand chronic depression I take wellbutrin in the morning plus a can   afternoon I have can at   bedtime I take two xanax and   venlfaxine it work for I it manage all of my illness
why would they put you on gabapentin for stress and depression it be a painkiller as far as I know and a strong one it can have serious mood effect for some people one person I know end up not be able to take it because he get really angry and lash out on it the electric shock you be have be a side effect of one of the pill you be take and mean that one of they be not agree with you   you need to get off it andor try something different this symptom be not normal nor should you tolerate it you could end up sicker I usually only get electric shock when come off they as a withdrawal symptom but I know other who get it while take they and they have to change med as soon as possible
I think it be just extreme anxiety and depression I do not think anything else be act up
slow down a little   breathe do not panic   understand that your fight effect your mental status   talk yell cry to your therapist    do not jump back in to the fry pan   at least for awhile   be you on med   with bipolar and anxiety disorder sound like you be   if not you might want to consider it with your dr   now some med can make you feel numb   do for I anyway   I too have bipolar and anxiety disorder along with other   be on many many different med combo and have have the numbness   talk with your dherapist    let they guide you   have also be in abusive relationship   whether it be physical   emotional or be abuse mentally   they all mess with your disorder   clear your head before make any major decision in regard to hook back up with he   be it woh it   you need to take care of you   talk to yourselfask yourself question   answer yourself   yes there will always be good time comfoe time but keep in mind the rocky time and again ask yourself if it be woh all that   how much can you take   but like I suggest talk with your dr and therapist   it help to get as much input as you can so you can choose what work for you   I finally come to the point of save myself from breakdown   and that be after a plan of suicide   good luck to you   I hope you get alot of feedback here also   you be in my prayer   god bless
I too have bi polar mixed bi polar and anxiety I often feel numb and doubt if I should be in a relationship I would love to be able to give you some advice but if you be anything like I when some one try to help I it becomes all scramble up in my head because of the anxiety all I can say be do not make a decision because you feel guilty for another person you have to do what you feel if you make the decision out of feel guilt for the other person then it will make thing bad for you and the other person but it always have to be what you want ok do not take this to hea ok it be just my way of think good luck x
do not make a decision until you feel stabilize I would also discuss this with a suppoive individual therapist or doc all mine tell I that my paner be create an atmosphere that make my disease bad in a cyclic manner so I may feel well for a bit and then crash again repeat abusive he control everything and it be scary I have not be stable for a long time   year
I have bipolar   and anxiety   I have be marry   year and can tell you nothing be easy   I tell my wife that I love she the good way I know how but sometimes I just suck at love   I think the pa about feel nothing for someone be more a pa of the disorder than real emotion   when I get to feel apathetic in my hea I use my brain my logic to reason with my self that I care deeply for those I love   I be   year old and I think fight lessen with age   I also do not believe there be one perfect person we be suppose to be with   the question to ask be be he a decent guyif I have a grown daughter would I want she to be with a guy like this   if so then probably a guy woh fight for   remember that you be a person wohy of love regardless of some diagnosis some doctor give you   be the good version of youokay I think that last pa I see on that show the office but you get the gist   good of luck
I remember feel numb in the past it be horrible be tell by your doctor that you have no feeling I be also go through a medication change all I want to do be sleep and drown the voice out with music on my mp player do not worry I know my medication be cause this like amber murder aguero say try to talk to he explain how you feel it be not unusual to feel numb do you blame he for any of your trouble if so it be love you go against the people you love the most
I have bipolar depression anxiety schizophrenic and ptsd so I be struggle beyond measure to not be an emotional wreck
I be on mixed if med for depressionanxietybipolar and after year of trial and error finally found one that work without a lot side effect but depend on the person for what work for they
yes I be try that too I stae this year go off my med find out the med be make I bad decicded to try other thing I take a vit for your brain help with stress memory mood and vit d and other also do essential oil there be recipe for all driffrent mental disorder and I find   for bipolar be you mix oil together and put they on your back of neck and forhead and wrist seem to help I
be careful with st johns will one side effect be agitationanxiety I learn that the hard way
same decent mood stabilizer valerian root can help some when take at onset of anxiety it be also decent for headache and muscle crampsspasm it be a sedative and muscle relaxant so please keep this in mind when take it
no problem I take a mg supplement with my med just fine it be an element that the body naturally need and it help muscle tension and constipation by loosen the digestive tract   one common product be milk of magnesia use to treat constipation it be in the hydroxide form it also draw water from the intestine which help soften fece and make they easy to pass I also do a mg regime after a hard conditioning workout for hockey or after a long training run it help alleviate some of the soreness the next day epsom salt bath be paicularly good for this purpose I actually use it in an ice bath to cut down the inflammation same as you would with a cold pack but for my entire body instead of a localize area the us rda on it be   mg per day for man about   for woman it come in several different form among they glycinate citrate and oxide I I know there be a minor contraindication with xanax and magnesium oxide but it be very rare consider to be clinically irrelevant some form will mess with the gut more than other   I can not take citrate but glycinate be good for I it be in my vitamin regimen with the blessing of my doctor even though I take an insanely high dosage and my body tolerate it well more than you ever need to know about mg I be sure but it be one of my staple for several issue also you can not really overdose on it   whatever the body can not use it will excrete
I have a similar reaction to all the med I be give I come off all med about a year agoit be really hard as it make I really ill even with doctor supervision since then I have cbt cognitive behavioural therapy I make fruit smoothie with as many antioxidant frit as I can I also add protein powder on top of that I walk   hour a day eat small amount of red meat lot of veggie I have regular blood test to make sure my body have enough vitamin dc and ion ext I have never feel so good I know it be still early day but I find the more natural I keep my diet it really help my mood the walking be very impoant other exercise would also help but I find the exercise in the outdoor be good for I I stop drink alcohol as this effect my mood and anxiety a lot I be also try to learn meditation to do before bed then put on relax music to fall to sleep with no voice just relax sound this together with the above have be more successful for I than any mesds   it be just as impoant to do this daily as you would take your med   I have bipolar   and suffer with anxiety I hope this information be useful please never come off any medication with at consult you doctor some doctor think only mesds will work but I disagree for I I also have the ability to use my bipolar mind which be my favourite pa to achieve amazing thing med block that pa redhea

cause sedation nausea restless leg tremor and grogginess all day long even take it the night before I feel like a slave to it   so glad I be off it now
make I incredibly tired severe weight gain night terror and terrible nightmare cause an incredible sugar craving as well   I go up to mg a day but eventually stop it
I have to increase high every month because I absorb and get use to thing fast I feel more anxious at night which do not help but it make I fall asleep every night which be amazing for I do not help with anything else though that I want it to though but everyone be obviously different
I be currently on it to help I sleep and use mgs just when need I use it early in the year also for anxiety I love it it help reduce the anxietypanic to a manageable level and it help I sleep deeply at night without that awful drug hangover feel you get from sleep pill and apparently it be not addictive although as I be try to cut down the usage I have to wonder if it be addictive or maybe I be just addict to a decent night sleep lol
I love how seroquel have help I I be able to sleep without paranioa and hearing voice I even wake up well rest refresh and in a good mental head space the only thing be it make I a horrible midnight snacker   therefore I gain a lot of weight now I be not as heavy   all I do to curve the weight gain be I take all my favorite snack food and replace they with healthy alternative and plus I walk to exercise I take mg at night before bedtime the only other nuisance be that some day it take about   hour to take effect but most of the time it knock I out in   minute   
lot of side effect at   mg a day but save my life help with paranoia and suicide thought
I bet it will help you gosh it sure do I you will over come the side effect enough to realize the benefit   be alive   I take other stuff too but the paranoia and self harm help be totally credit to seriquil I be not to proud to admit it save my life big hug   you for what your deal with I have be there
horrible nightmare that be so real I would wake up super anxious and tearful
trouble swallow restless leg weight gain tremor it work great for my mood and sleep but the side effect be too much for I to handle
med be individual I ha shake really bad phycotic vision
I have be on seroquel for about   year it definitely cause a lot of sedation have no idea how people take it during the day and   weight gain be a likely side effect as well   I be up to   and then decrease to   and it be the most uncomfoable process I have ever be through   severe body ache sweat nausea and an out of control mood so just take the minimum that will control your symptom as get the dose down will be hard
I be on mg at first I get restless leg really bad on the low dose and now at   they be go I do get the munchie after I take it and I have gain weight on it but overall it seem to work for I
you will get fat   and tired   restless leg syndrome
I take it for a while mg I would take it and within   min I be knock out asleep I would take it at sleepover and my friend would make fun of I because I would sta babble incorrectly and pass out I would sleep with no minimum of   hour and get off of it be a bitch withdrawal and irritability we be make my life hell then but as a medication for mood stability it work very well probably one of the good I have take faitige be the main down fall
make my anxiety worsemade I restless could not wake up from deep sleep would eat everything in my path
it give I restless legsand I be always sleep
I struggle with this daily
scary place ever
my dear sister I be soooooosorry that I embarrass you it be not mean to be that way I will always love you as I recall we speak on the telephone just a few day ago you offer no help at all I know you can not be hear and I know you can not afford a lot I just wish for hope doris do nothing so it be all stuck on I I do not appreciate that I have fill for section   then I will not have nothing to do with dad
sometimes   medication be not always the answer I use to struggle to sleep most night   brain over think to many thing   or i d fall asleep and then have a disturbed sleep maybe wake up to   time   I always try go bet at the same time as it get I into a routine like you would as a child then I listen to music on youtube   music for anxiety   music for insomnia   there be so many   and some of they play for the whole   hour and I find there the one that help I stay asleep   if they be just quick one that send you off and only last   min I be up again within two hour   your ear be the only thing that do not sleep   I find this really help I along side take my mood stabiliser and anxiety tablet
so simple and so cheapcelestial season sleepy time tea I be not exaggerate it work as well as any sleeping pill I have take without any side effect I be most recently on restoril and it work but it be literally make I sick so I decide to stop take it I be terrify of not be able to sleep and my psychiatrist ask I to just give the tea a try with my regular night time med it knock I out all night I wake the next morning completely shock that I have sleptwith no nightmare I could not remember anything just deep warm relaxed sleep and I have no morning migraine or nausea like every other day on restoril it be amazing but I guarantee you   doc be not go to suggest it cost   for a box of   woh twenty time that   good luck  
what a horrible message to reinforce to someone who struggle so they have enough issue with self defeat they need to see message of their woh
my boyfriend have stick around I live in fear of he leave meeveryone leave as I have nothing positive to offer anyone
no worry   
actually I prefer to be know as a manic depressivebipolar be often confuse with schizophrenia
yeah they take a psychotropic concoction call ayahuascaa mixture of dmt and monoamine oxidiser inhibitorsthey also use it for chronic drug addiction do not think it would go well with lithium though  
no I be not I do recommend epilim over lithium for high or low blood pressure hawthorne tablet work
blood pressure off the chas though
I think first of all you must have a happy life before deside to try a quit medication I been try sometimes and I be try right now but I be very calm and happy that help but I notice I get upset more easy than with medication   good luck
you should not have to feel nervous it be our body I be on lamictal and wellbutrin and a few other and just one week drop my dose then the next week drop it again then I be off and I do great I have trade all my med for clean eating exercise and essential oil it be something I have to plan and work on daily but it be natural abd my body feel great no more side effect from all those med redhea   good luck and listen to your own body
well what work well for one person may not for another   tell your dr that these paicular med make you feel nervous   maybe even edgy    some med that I have be on in the past make I feel like I be go to crawl out of my skin   so tell you dr   they will then sta lower your dosage and try a different med   plenty of med out there so it may take time to find the right combo   if you plan to stop take they on your own before you can get in to see your dr taperr off they very slowly   very slowly   cut back a pill at a time but do it every couple   week if not   week   yes it be a slow process but do not stop abruptly   the risk be far to dangerous   I have have to taper off many med that make I feel uncomfoable   so I speak with many year experience    if you can see   your dr as soon as possible that be the good way to go   do not be discourage that these   med be not work for you   like I say there be many many more to try   hopefully you find this helpful   you be in my prayer
do   you want to be mentally stable or do you want to worry about your size there be still way to maintain a healthy weight wether you be on med or not
obsess with philosophyto the point where like in the matrix take the red pill no go back the human world as oppose to the natural world seem so strange to I

I hear you I prefer to have more meaningful conversation with people and that make it difficult and awkward to talk to people who do not want to think a bit deep
he be not a friend sadly the world be fill with these people they be manipulative and selfcentered and with time you will learn to avoid they because you will understand that you be much well than this you be on high ground and they do not like that they want to drag you down and you do not need toxic people in your life even if that mean have to be on your own I can tell you briefly about my personal experience with these people read on if that interest you   I have good friend they be   we use to hang out together all the time for   year we be like brother then come that night when they be all hang out at one of they as usual so I go up to see they and they staed attack I one say I be a bitch one say I be a hypocrite and a liar one say I be insignificant and the last one just tell I that since his brother think of I that way then he want no connection with I I try to explain thing but they be not listen it be like talk to wall so I hurriedly rush out of the apament drive my car fast away from they I be cry I feel miserable when I arrive home I notice a text from one of they say be you on drug it be the most huful text I have ever receive I will never forget this text instead of say something nice they still want to hu I some more I never reply and I never see they again it be a shock for I not have friend especially that I lose touch with everyone else during these   year I try to make connection it never work I still feel the emptiness of be alone   year later but I be grow tough now I be learn that I do not need people to feel good that I can do my own thing by myself I still miss have friend around though but then I remember that story and I think to myself perhaps I be well off this way
I be sorry your feeling hu   sometimes my husband act similarly and I get so anxious   since he at this point be just a friend I would let this relationship go   you deserve so much well   there be people that understand mental illness and be kind   I will keep you in my prayer

vivi ann mephami appreciate your replymy friend do not understand the way I ammy family do not talk to I so it be all mei be   and my cptsd and depression anxiety and that major one the way I see my future   it be hellmy therapist   st oneleft town after   year of talk to she and now this new one be an interni just can not get to the source of all this I want to get it all out and be do with it but it never go awayguess my strength will still hold I upjust wish I do not go through all this to end up die aloneso sadgod bless we both
just ask your gp they do understand it be not good to stop all at once because of side affect do not be afraid to ask the question but be prepare for the response sometimes we feel we can do without medication I have try numerous time only to end up back on they
just say you would like to try and see how you could get on without tablet and could they help you wean off they I be sure you already know you can not just stop tablet and least lower it slowly be an aim and a goal I have bpd and its rather different to bp but its the similar principle also I be in the uk so I be unsure how the medical practising work over there if you feel you do not need they just talk to they if you be nervous take someone with you or write a note and give they it so they can understand good luck x
user and obnoxious man be the one put themselves out there cus they know what they want if an insecure woman do not feel want she will not notice you when you do do not be obnoxious but speak up and be honest I prob would not be the only woman who would appreciate it if the nice guy stand up once and a while
it really depend often my own experience etc be what make I awesome at my job because people can tell that I genuinely empathize and my knowledgeexperience allow to well help other but sometimes I find the stresswork hourssometime even the environment etc of nursing negatively impact my own mental health I love what I do know I be good at it but in all honestly there have be time I have consider change career and there be time I do struggle a bit really its something you have to decide on your own   good wish
I be a qualified nurse for   year with depressionanxiety and bpd but I have have to give it up as my shitty memory and dread od something go wrong do not make I a safe practioner it be know when to stop my mental health problem give I more empathy with all my patient x x
I be a nurse and have bipolar depression I believe this make I a well nurse people see a mental illness as something terrify it be not it make we strong and more aware of other that suffer take your med counselling and time for your mental health no one be allow to discriminate against you you know your own limit be a great nurse and make a difference
I be an right now and have to retire   year ago my mental health be affect my job and I be not risk med error etc our job do not define we xxx
er   if she will not go call a doctor to find out how you get an emergency psych hold   you may need to see if she have a medical power of attorney   she could be in a depressive psychosis which be no joke   well safe than sorry   do not worry about piss she off   well she be alive and piss than dead
all I want be to be hold tight lot of love and affection and to be reassure that the one person I need the most be there even if I try and push away I need they to pull I close it be fuck up when I act like I do not need they or want they when I really do   more then ever bad thing to do be to leave they alone or go in a mood coz they be be ignorant or awkward by ignore you sometimes we want to talk and communicate but just can not as the word will not come out it be horrible especially when ask what be wrong   and we really do not know in my experience if someone try to shut you out and push you away then pull they in close tight affectionate hug and kiss and just talk to they about anything and everything they may not respond for a while but they be listen and it be take their mind away from how they be feel and pull then back into the real word
mine be yes newly adjust and they say it take week to adjust the anxiety have increase since it be
you first need to work out weather you can handle this as this be not go to a one off if you can just be there lye with she hold her hand   sit with she just offer he a few reassuring word make her comfoable   do she have a care plan of what she like when she poorly if not when she well   make one so you have insight which help she it can be very distressing to watch and it normal to feel uselessthere not much that can be do apa from be understanding and make they comfoable and safe also look after yourself there be carer suppo out there too all the good   all the good
do not do that unless she have take something it will make it worst make the person feel shameful or just piss they off   lot of love and heavy blanket
I tend to do this on my paner good thing we do be put on something I love on netflix   snuggle up be there greatly comfos the pain get overwhelming it be never personal
make a fruit smoothy put honey and protein powder in it   I would not put her med by the bed but take they to she with a large glass of water give the house a good clean as I feel so guilty when I come round and I see all the thing I have let go in my home you could always get some relaxing music just sound no voice meditation music you should maybe go and see her docter or therapist for advice you need someone to it will help you feel strong   depend on how bad you think this be only you will know as you know her good   she might need some outside suppo your amazing she be very lucky to have you and I be sure you feel the same about she when she come round tell she how proud you be of she and how much you love she she will probably feel really guilty and it be a very fragile time fresh air and a walk in the peaceful country side be good when she be up to it x
and for god sake do not tell she she be fake it like my otherhalf just do when have a panic attack
I do this I know what would make I happy when I be like this surround she with soft cosy stuff quilt blanket make she a safe nest you do not need word if she be happy for you to stroke her hair do it if not do not take it personally above all else right now she need to feel secure quietly check on she no loud noise do not try and move she from where she be even if she look uncomfoable just create a nest around her   this too shall pass she will return send love xx
I do that honestly give her time to calm down sometimes it will be one or two day for I I do not want to talk or anything I get in an argument or stress or something and it make I just shut down
just lie down beside herhold she and tell she you understand when I shut down like thisit because the pain be overwhelming and I can not thinkmove or talk I wish my husband would understand but he just yell at I and call I lazy that be the bad thing to do
honey that be absolutely horrible I hope you find someone who deserve you real soon you be a good person even if some people do not want to see it
this person be not say to give up this person be struggle themselves and have be give up on and be simply reach out I believe   not in any way say to give up on she but rather that in his experience people have just give up he be say to please stick it out and just give her space just my opinion on it
I be look for advice hear   I suffer from depressiin and anxiety but I have be ask if I have bipolar twice during debate I have search symptom and can not really decide myself   can anyone give I advice please xxx

I just need to say that whether you agree or disagree with this post that be no need to put someone down for fuck sake we be all deal with depression anxiety or other mental disorder and the one put other people down be probably why I understand you need to get happiness any way you can but if it mean be a pompous ass then you have bad problem to deal with anyone should be able to ask anything without be make feel like they be stupid or crazy
I be super panic all of the sudden this morning but it pass quickly I have be depress the last week so maybe it be a sign of new light come at least I hope so
I have not think of that and I have no idea if there be a connection but I always get hypomanic at the same time every month but this time it be last a lot long than usual I can not shake it   and I be also very depressed   if weather can give I headache who knowsmaybe there be something to this   never say never   I just wish it would go away

I get it sometimes I panic when my husband fall asleep even though he be right beside I because then I feel alone again
I can not sleep and I try go to bed but my mind just race and I just think horrible thought and be so alone x
I have the same issue can not go on overnight trip or anything without severe anxiety
seraline save my life seriously I have be take it off and on for year and it be the only medication that work well for both my anxiety and depression note some doc will not tell you this but make sure to eat with it good luck
personally I do not react well on it   after three day I could not stand it make my anxiety skyrocket make I dizzy and nauseous light head and just generally feel crap
I take it at the end of last year for depression and anxiety I find it make my anxiety bad for the first couple of week then it settle down I never shake the awful headache it keep give I after a few month so come off it everyone be different though so just track any change and if you be not feel well talk to your doctor about change I hope it work for you though
I be on seraline mg for deoressionbut feel it be not work I just feel constantly down and scare it be effect my marraige can anyome suggest anything   I can not pin point what make I down but its so hard to just snap out of it
my pharmacist    you will feel absolutely horrible for the first two week do not stop take it though you just have to get through the first two week the first two week be god damn awful   in the end I need a high dose but I could not afford to go back to my dr it help my anxiety a lot   I go from have multiple moderate to severe anxiety attack every day to like one manageable one but make I very aloof I be not sad anymore but that be because I could not really access any of my emotion   not sure if that help but that be my experience with it I would consider go back on a high dose if I could   no health insurance at the moment
I have be on setraline for almost a year and have no side effect when I staed but I have recently go up to mg and I be get the bad brain zap but they be help so I just work through it I have depression anxiety and trait of borderline personality disorder and they seem to be work for I
I take mg for depression which work really well for I I also take quetiapine at night or through day for anxiety and they work well for I
staed on it   month ago and it have be life change fori do have depressionanxiety and borderline personality at first I feel flat and emotionless but then realise it be my background anxiety have stop so my brain be quieter if that make sensei totally agree with the dry mouthwe be slowly increase the dose till hopefully I will have peace x
it affect we differently so do not be scared if it do not work for you there be always other that you could try but it could suit you fantastically so it be get to be woh try with myself I be worried at first as I would try a few other anti depressant but after try mg for a few week I realise it be good and go up to mg there have be a few side affect on the way but not as bad as some other and in the long run it be make a noticeable difference try it and see what happen and if it do not suit you then you can always try another drug
I staed on mg and then mg after   week anxiety be definately much well   I have be on seraline for along time and lithium and both suit I well
I take mg it be not help with my anxiety or my depression because they have add another antidepressant I take   pill at night for bipolar with severe anxiety I have not experience any of these side effect I have have no side effect at all
I love it   I take it for my manic depression and it do wonder it do not seem to help I with my anxiety though   we be about to up my dose to see if it will currently on mg   but yeah I get dry mouth a lot   but it be a good way for I to have to stick to my   glass a day   definitely woh the small side effect for the huge relief
I be staed on mg but it aremy depression worse also very dry mouth with it horrible medication to take everyone be different though give it time to go into your system and see how you get on x
keep a journal when you sta so you can tell you doctor what if any symptom you be have take it   I be only on xanax for anxiety   mg
staed on mg   be increase to mg   then to mg   I find it dry I up something fierce but that may be the mix of my other med carbemazepine leviteracitam   diazepam as well I would be tell that high dose of seraline could work for anxiety as well as depression but right now I be only indicate for depression
I really struggle with seraline it make I bad
I take   mg I suffer with severe ocd and it have make my life so so much well it have also decrease my anxiety it change my life
I be not schizophrenic and I hear a voice that be not my own mental voice but I have dissociative depersonalisation disorder and ptsd it be always a good idea to speak to your doctor about your worry I believe there be test that can help pinpoint the issue

copy and paste from a page hope it help in regard to bipolar bipolar be a complex mental health disorder   its most common form be bipolar I mania and depression and bipolar ii hypomania and depression however other form do exist   due to the cyclic nature of this disorder it be often time difficult to treat   and because of societys stigmatization of the disorder those who be suffer from bipolar often time feel embarrassed or ashamed lead to they not get the help they need bipolar I be the most common form of bipolar that society talk about   it be characterize by a cycle of really high high and really low low   individual with this type of bipolar may experience a period of normal mood in between mood swing during which their mood and energy level feel right and their ability to function be not disturb   during the high period symptom can include take on too many activity at once spend money in way that because trouble become more talkative outgoing or sexual and consumption or increase consumption of alcohol andor drug   these symptom may lead to other perceive the sufferer as strange or annoying and can cause trouble with coworker or authority figure   during the low period sufferer often feel a lack of energy a need to stay in bed or get extra sleep and little or no motivation to do thing they need to do   they often put on weight during these period and feel sad or depress all the time   sometimes during the low phase they may feel helpless or even suicidal   their ability to function at work or socially can become impaired bipolar spectrum diagnostic scale    bipolar ii be characterize by hypomania mean a slight increase in mood follow by depression   hypomanic episode be define by feel incredibly productive and happy   sufferer may see themselves as be in a high function mode and feel that there be nothing wrong during these period   the depressive episode be define by a prolong period at least two week of feeling of sadness hopelessness and disinter in take pa in life during these low phase sufferer often feel fatigued restless agitated unfocused indecisive and in some case suicidal bipolar spectrum diagnostic scale because bipolar involve both high and low it can be difficult to treat   if someone stay manic their physician will focus on bring their mood down to a healthier happy   this however can be difficult to accomplish as many people who suffer from mania enjoy the extra energy creativity and intensity that come with it   likewise it can be difficult to treat the depression that come with bipolar because the medication use to treat the depression can unfounately because a manic episode   it be also not uncommon for bipolar medication to stop work oveime cause an individual who be once stable on medication to cycle and have to sta the search for an effective medication over again   lastly some of the medication use to treat bipolar be know for cause side effect in some people   know this keep some people from try medication that might actually help they    from my   year work with an adult psychiatrist and my   year as a licensed counselor I can attest to the stigma many individual suffer from bipolar struggle with   society have wrongly blame bipolar disorder for cause people to commit horrific act such as assault and murder   society have also misuse the term in a negative sense to describe people they do not like strange weather mechanical issue with their car etc the list go on   these derogatory and inaccurate association keep people from seek help because they fear be diagnose with bipolar and then be label as crazy and dangerous by their family and friend   when I have a client that have receive an official diagnosis of bipolar from a doctor one of the first thing I often have to do be work with they to see and accept that society be wrong that they be truly not crazy or dangerous   I then have to help they work through their fear of be out cast by everyone in their life so that they can tell their mom or dad or good friend about their diagnosis and what they be go through   overall bipolar can be one of the hard mental health disorder to suffer from   it can present differently from person to person but it always have a component of fluctuating mood   the good thing someone suffer from bipolar can do be think about how wrong society be about most thing and then remind themselves that society be wrong about bipolar too heather n smith med   license professional counselor supervisor
the depressive state of bipolar   can last for day or long   that be dangerous for the person affect because they be definitely at risk for suicide  
bipolar be just horrid x
psychosis can manifest in extreme maniatrust I I knowi have have a few psychotic episode where I be extremely paranoid and delusionalhe need help but he need to want to get help
his paranoia and delusion may get bad and that could be dangerous he really need to be hospitalize
honey that be not bipolar that be paranoid schizophrenia
I have bipolar   and I have psychosis twice I have to be hospitalize twice I be very paranoid and be think to be schizophrenic at the first hospital I have be properly medicate for almost a year and a half and have not have any delusion since be hospitalize my parent have to call the cop on I the nd time
may not be bipolar at all   he could have paranoid schizophrenia   you may not be able to easily convince he to visit a doctor   he may sta assume you be pa of the conspiracy that be against he and fight against it   your sisterinlaw may have to try to get he commit to a hospital in order to get he any help   if there be moment of lucidity in his thinkingbehavior where he be less ill and more compliant you may be able to talk he into go to see the doctor   however if you do do not wait to do it   take he immediately when he be willing to go   he may cycle back into psychosis quick than you expect   in case you do not know a person in fullblown psychosis can become violent or dangerous if they feel threatened   be careful how you handle he   my good wish be with you
I have a friend with schizoaffective disorder   paranoia who have these issue but be open to and grateful for help however their sibling be much more severe and see everything and everyone as pa of a plot obviously help be need but resoe to trickery or section could prove the belief correct please seek advice and suppo from mental health agency well wish x

firstly do not assume anything unless you have a diagnosis secondly it look like you be go to struggle in get that diagnosis if he be over   and be either a threat to himself or other he can be section under the mental health act as an adult he be also able to refuse treatment so unless he be willing to be see by a health proffesional then he be go to continue to struggle unless you can convince he the his problem can be soe if he do see someone good luck

see I do not deal well neighbor be you an upstairs neighbor well if you be stomp around really loud upset they a lot I would slam my door extremely hard when they would do it I would even put my bass stereo on the floor and play whatever loud music you would like but my advice be probably not the good I deal with young pay girl move in an out all the time and I just end up get really passive aggressive towards they like they take up all   spot we have in the lot for their friend so I just park my car where they could not get out
I would also try to reach out to the neighbor and gain their sympathy or   ask the landlord manager if the door can be muffle or put on one of those hinge that control how fast or slow the door close so that it close slow however I have be in similar situation and have see the supposedly gain sympathy and understanding bear little other fruit it be hard but much more effective to reduce your hope of change other people action and try to decondition yourself as much as you can even if it be just a little increase your tolerance and flexibility will serve you and other the most in the long run I also have a lot of anxiety and have be trouble by loud sudden noise ironically I have an emotional suppo dog who also hate sudden loud noise especially of the bang variety his barking and my needing to comfo quiet he have actually help increase my tolerance of such sound whatever happen I have faith in your ability to find resolution the situation can not go on forever good luck
I never want to relapse but I often struggle with the hospital or home I pretty much always want to die
get upset and frustrate with today society    suffer with major depression suicide be never off my mind but in this day and age   there be no compassion conversation feeling or interaction it be all about I want want want want selfish people be all I can say sad but true         sometimes a hug be nice

sunshine fresh air music   I make a conscious decision to put up with the trough because I love the peak although the beta blockersdiazepam get rid of   of the associate anxiety as long as the ptsd do not synch up with the more extreme highslow then I be pretty safe
no this be not normal   get your thyroid check   check your diet   med checkget you some buspar get that exhaust anxiety in check   get some exerciseeven just a walk around the block
how do you like the adderal I stae the small dose   time a day I only have maybe   idea or chatter in my head at once instead of   but just can not sta to fix my house so overwhelming
funny you should mention that currently I be on epilim for ptsd but find it be shoot my vision however I be trialle on ritalin once by my old psychiatrist but could not get my script refill so far due to have to change psychiatrist and this one prefer epilim but when I do try it sho term it both fix my fatigue and apathy massively and slow down my bpd and ptsd thought process include flashback and force I to be in the moment and mindful so it definitely help I massively now its just a struggle as my psychiatrist have advise I I will need to see a private psych on the side to get my benzo and ritalin manage because they be not allow to nor comfoable with prescribing either same go for my gp
especially when you be mentally disturb
I hear the same thing dailyit just make I bad     like why can not I just shake it offwhy be I so weak tired explain it to people now I just say yup that be I a wack job I really do not think people can relate unless they experience it I be a horrible person most daysmaybe it be all my fault     hope you get some suppo before you turn cold like I
ignore they    you be the one live with it    take I   year to get here   I be ashamed I have bp and I try to hide it from other do I no good    look in the mirror and say I be beautiful and I have a disease that do not define I than live your life try to stay in remission
I be go through the same thing     my paner do not believe that depression anxiety and bp exist and that there be no such thing as a chemical imbalance of the brain can not argue with the man because he will not budge on his opinion so annoying to deal with
I agree with babie I have to threaten my mom with not have a relationship with I if she do not stop treat I badly for be sick I know that sound mean but what she be do and say be mean and I just sit she down one day and firm but respectfully lay it all out on the table the more I kno about be bipolar and the more I look back my mom be too just untreated but if she stop for my health I would have have to walk away and with your spouse if they can not be suppoive than that be not how ya love someone
it be hard for some people in general to understand those of we suffer from bipolar even when I be commit there where still people in my family who just do not except the fact I be suffer from a disorder and believe my condition do not exist to they it be all in my head and I be in a mood or seek attention I have learn to accept that they be just not ever go to accept the fact that bipolar disorder be something many of we suffer from all I can say I deal with each day as well as I can critic and all because I have a hard enough time just try to get through the day let alone worry about what people in my family think I truly wish I could have be more use take care
it make I forget everything my sho term memory be all wacky it be horrible I get off of it quickly good luck
it have help wonder for my bipolar and anxiety however I hate the side effect slow down feel burn and pin and needle feeling in foot and constant thirst then I love this medicine though but however it have cause I to lose a lot of weight and I have always be small and my doctor say if I can not stop lose weight he be do blood work to rule out health concern and they be great but he say I be lose to much weight as I be already in a size   and can wear s he be say if it continue I will be mal nutrition and it suck because it be the only medicine that be work for my bp
I cry all day every day on it   I be a mess it be horrible
I be on it my dr be hope it will help I with an add side effect of weight lossappetite suppressant I definitely eat less I can not say I have lose weight I be still just in staing stage of test it to see if it be a good med for I dr take I off depakote and replace it with topomax I be now up to    pill x for a week and then   pill x a day staing next week pair with wellbutrin and adivan for anxiety bipolar and clinical depression I be begin to feel a little bit normal again it be still early and I still have rough day but it be get well
some people be on allot of medicatipn but that be ok if it be help do not worry about it I go off all my med and it be a mistake just remember be not your fault and it be ok to take allot of medication everyone be different god bless oh and I be back on they now and I be grateful I have they
the good advice be stay on your med it be when people with our diagnosis sta think I be fine or I hate take they that they get into trouble stop feel ashamed or think it be sad yes it suck yes it be a struggle every single day do not let it define you who care what people think in fact I be very open about it your journey can help so many people  
I suffer from very bad anxiety and I be on xannax and clonazepam   I do not tell people either except my parent and husband what med I be on   you should not be scared or discourage because you be get the help that you need   ton of people just self medicate and do not want to get the help so you be go in the right direction by see someone and take med   this forum be great and everyone on here should understand   good luck and stay strong

my first thought be get to your dr as soon as possibleand let they know what you be feelingit have be repoe that infusion of ketamine will eliminate suicidal thought for up to a weekdo not know if that will work for you but I would askyour obsession be so of like a seisurenot likely to get well on its ownwill not pretend to know what you be go throughbut some ssris can cause these thought know in people under   yrs oldmight ask to switch to another ssrimy symptom be fear not suicide
my parent be still in denial my mom understand something be wrong but not exactly what it be and my dad just tell I it be all in my head I mean duh it be lol but he do not mean it like that I be diagnose with depression at   bipolar and bpd at   I be   now and they be still tell I this haha it frustrate I and make I kind of upset when people do not understand or make an effo to understand but still feel the need to put their   cent in   I be not religious so when people give I that I get even more upset
I would probably explain to they that bipolar disorder be the same as have cancer you can not just make it go away if they will not accept that I would probably unfriend because who need that crap I say this as a person with both bipolar and with cancer the bipolar scare I more they cut the cancer out
my mom say shit like that to I I tend to shake my head smile say I know and then either walk away or make a joke about how god need to stop test I it be hard to deal with people like that they just do not understand
I stop care about people comment they be ignorant and I have too much I be deal with to enteain they I just do not mention it to those kind of people anymore my life be less stressful and I be at piece with my bipolar at she point I try explain that its the same as have diabete you do not ask for it it have no cure but can be maintain
I have have many people doubt I be bipolar some doubt bipolar be really even a thing I know the truth and have to be satisfied with that it hus I share post on mental illness in the hope they can well understand it be a struggle
to deny who you be be to deny the one that make you if I where to be tell something like this   that be what I would say and then I tell they that their comment while probably and in all honesty well mean make I feel like I should be ashamed of who I be I should feel bad for how I think I should feel guilty for accept that I have an illness I should lie to myself fight myself tear myself apa because I can not be who I be then I would explain that by do all those thing   I would lose any ground I have gain to recover cope and learn how to be
bipolar be not a title to be ashamed of it be just a way to describe brain function religion also have nothing to do with bipolar either and I be a christian child of god can have all different form of brain function whether it be bipolar schizophrenia asd do bpd typical etc accept bipolar or any other mental health concern as a pa of the self still make one a child of god and then after say that I would include some helpful aicle link to help educate she and other on the truth about bipolar
it would piss I straight off grow up whenever I attempt to talk to my folk about my depression and anxiety I be meet with you just need to work on your relationship with the lord and thing will work out every single time mental health condition and religion be two separate thing so many christian in this country can not see anything without try to out a jezeus stamp on it grrrrrr
I would want they to validate I in that yes I struggle with bipolar disorder that be not all that I be it be not my identity it be pa of it completely want to squash it be very ignorant in my opinion and they and countless other around the world need to end the stigma ps I have such issue finish project and lose interest after a sho or long burst of intense making knitting in my case buy ton of yarn then get too apathetic and depressed to knit so I feel you also I be polish too which I think be great that you mention     for the chuckle and for the way that it be a pa of you just like bp and should be treat as such hope that help
I think they call it a label bc they be uncomfoable with it    you be notit stigmatize   they do not even know it
hi I would have do what briana suggest I know from my illness I get really upset at what be happen to you and so please do not let it get on top of you sweep I t aside and move on I have ptsd and people have say that I be okay I do watercolour ggrr its so annoying how upsetting people can be with their big gobs
the same way you do because I feel the same way and do the same thingsalthough I be never allow to have friend in my previous marriage make new one be hard for I because I be afraid I will not be accept with my problem
it dosent matter what people say but if you have a mental illness your not go to believe positive thing I would know I be struggle with three mental illness so I know the struggle be real hope this make sense
I honest would get upset cuz I would feel like there downplay   my issue and not take it serious and act like my mental health be a bad thing
when someone say something like that it make I feel like I embarrass they I be just try to get a grip on it and accept it myself please do not make I feel bad and question myself even more
when I be first diagnose as bipolar my mom keep say that I be not she do not believe the dr but in the same breath eod say that she think that the   bipolar med be help I think that there be so much stigma on mental health issue that still cloud the truth today I use to explain my depression before the bipolar like cancer I can treat it and it can go into remission but it be never really go and I do not do anything wrong to get it it be a sickness just like get cancer it can be hereditary thing can happen in life that can make you more vulnerable to it but you can not speak it into or out of existence
bp depression will make you feel this way I be on an up swing and I be terrify at the down swing
my daughter be just on it she be   with bpd anxiety depression and adhd this med aggravate the depression and make it worseso she go back on ritalin
make my anxiety bad to be honest
wow effexor be fantastic for bipolar and depression zero side effect when first take it but do not forget to take it you will get little head zap and dizzy spell I be currently go through it as I type this message not that I forget to take it I just do not have the money until tomorrow to fill my script its horrible   
I mess up my first script on a small dose and take   a day instead of   and be leave with   day with no pill think I be die of the flu horrible withdrawal my doc do not want to give I anything else for my anxiety and bpd at the moment so I be hope this help
there should be a crisis intervention service in your area   you will find one or if its too overwhelming pm I x
share this because this fit it perfect it be my exact struggle everyday
yes unless you suffer from depression and anxiety issue you will never understand how hard it be to live day by day and keep go like everything be normal
this be true for man as well except I do not wear mascara have struggle for over   year now and care for my paner who be bipolar
it be a hole that seem to get deep each day you fear experience happiness even for just a moment because it will not last or something bad will happen nothing good ever last
it be a very deep dark hole that I so desperately want to get out of to see the sunlight but can not reach the top   and no people that do not have it do not understand   even if they try
very true   be there do that   not proud of it either   ashame    thank to med I be on now the mutilation pa be over   just can not stabilize the depression
sooo true its horrible   people do not understand wen you just want to stay home   sometimes just be on you be own cos you feel like shit
to be ill be to be holistically affect in both neuron or nervous tissue and somatic tissue as   the brain influence not only itself but the holistic physique the head include the whole self   sure neuron and somatic cell differ from one another but the neuron be in control over the somatic cell   the forebrain first begin to appear together with the hea in the human embryo at three week   both brain and hea be connect by the vagus nerve
truebut we can not feel other people pain or do anything about itso maybe selfishly it be about I and I should not feel guilty
this be exactly the double standard that be force upon those with mental illness   sure someone may have it bad   however if the people who be normal would stop impose their view on the mentally ill there would be more understanding for the mental illness and no criticism or its companion guilt
the bad be when you be the one tell yourself other have it bad so you do not worry about yourself
these thing you be go through and thinking of be heavy burden   my big concern be your self medicate and self harm   that be a deadly combination   please please be honest with your dr and flat out tell they when you can   but first you really should go to the hospital and get care   please   they can monitor you get you on med that take away the thought and action of self harm   and that would be one less thing on your already overload plate   I have be there with both self medicate and self harm   suicidal thoughtsect   the hospital will have resource to give you for suppo group for all of your issue   take baby step and yes break it down to one day at a time   I even break it down to one minute at a time sometimes    do not be afraid to reach out like you be do now   it take ball to do what you be do   you be on the right path   baby step   reach out to all of we here   do not be afraid to pray and ask our heavenly father for help   he want and expect to hear from you   he love you   he will help you   but be proud of yourself for take this first step   and remember   if the dr you have be not work with you or for you find a new one   it take I several before I finally find one I could be truly honest with   I wish you the good my friend   god bless
that be a devastating thing to have happen to you   there be no word   it be a tragic thing to happen to a child   of course it change the child for ever   please do not let what happen define who you be now   you can let it go and move forward with your life   make peace with the past and write your future   make it whatever you want it to be   find out who you be away from the pain    you can do anything   find what make you happy   do not worry about your sexuality    it do not matter    one day when you get yourself together you will meet someone to love and who will love you back   girl or boy    it do not matter

before you get a girlfriend you have to get your head together   I also be sexually abuse by man   you be rightit affect every relationship   however help be out there   selfharm and selfmedicating will not do you an ounce of good in the long run   if you want a girlfriend and maybe child you have to stop let the abuse control you   master it like you would master play the piano   it be scary at firstbut with professional help it be doable   build a suppo system around yourself and a close relationship with your therapist   choose a good friend someone you can confide in   use these tool to rise above the abuse   it be time to lance the boil and get the poison out   I believe in you   believe in yourself
malena valentin you be right however then you be confused not actually gay food for thought dani
not always bear gay many time when a child be sexually abuse he she may be confuse due to the abuse
look after urself sleep well stay away from stress do thing you enjoy   check side effect of you be med maybe there alternative or you cud do well without ceain med if one give   you lot of prob or switch to another
I be also bipolar with anxiety and adhd throw in   I actually recently have a nervous breakdown and the thing that get I through be my journal and music I reach out and realize I have very little suppo which really hu   I also have a therapist that help I so much   and med of course   but I be so sorry you be go through this   you be not alone   and when you be feel really low and want to bash yourself try so hard to realize that you be impoant and wohy   be kind to yourself   I struggle with that myself   but you will get through this
one day at a time and try to stay away from your trigger and if that do not work you could face your fear and see if that work for you
I could have write this post my family have no concept of what bipolar be all they do be yell at I my anxiety can get so bad that I lose it and can get nasty my med do not work I have be on countless useless medication I only see my psychiatrist about once every two to three month not good I call he yesterday to change my anxiety med so far I have not hear back from he I will give he a couple of more hour if he do not call back I will call he again I will turn myself into a pain in the ass if I have to I really do not care anymore my brother commit suicide because he could not stand the pain from depression anymore thankfully I be not suicidal I just want to be give med that actually work I be afraid to go to sleep at night because I know the anxiety I will wake up with oh yeah I be raise my   year old grandson it be very difficult I be sorry for ramble thank for listen
on the bright side the anxiety and depression be probably symptom of the bipolar so you actually only have one problem not three   if you have bp then that might account for the psychosis too   in which case you be   for    a good result treat the bp and most of the other stuff be manageable
I want you to know that you be not alone   I too suffer from these disorder along with panic ptsd agorophobia   fear of people and insomnia   many different med though the year   all I can suggest be therapy if you be not already go   very impoant   do not give up on med   there be sooo many out there   unfounately   it take time and the right combination   keep try   if they do not work make the dr try something else   also very impoant be if your dr do not work for and with you get another   I have learn the hard way   try to eat regularly   easier say then do but force yourself if you have to   get   hour of sleep   if you can   when and if I do sleep I seem to handle all the muck well   and we all know exercise help though very hard to do when you feel like you do   at least for I   I do not know if you be spiritual   but I do alot of pray   I pray for the drs to find the right combo of med I pray for healing   I cry out to our heavenly father   and spill my gut   he lighten the load   there be a verse in the bible among so many other that I pray over and over again   I can do all thing through christ who strengthen I pick up the bible say a prayer for something in it to comfo you please do not feel alone   if ceain people do not understand do not share with they   cry out to you dr and find people that be there   I be here I will listen    reach out to people if you can   I learn that the hard way too   I do not know of any off the top of my head but ask your dr if they know of any suppo group   I hope at least one thing here help you   get as many suggestion as you can and pick and choose what work for you   you be in my thought and prayer   god bless you
I be over sensitive and be diagnose with depression I stay awake most night think about all sos of thing that make I cry   I be a marijuana advocate for the exact reason med never work for I and the only thing that ever do be that without the bad side effect like of other pharmaceutical my family would never suppo although it do really work I would not suggest see a therapist because they be all just stranger and I have always become extra anxious and paranoid when I get out because I would think I say something bad or off but someone close to you to confine in like a good friend that would not hold anything against you I just recently come out with my problem to a few of mine and it do seem to help a littleat least know you be not alone   
spend outdoor activity with your close friend that boost your self esteem and do not ovehink about anything because it can cause anxiety and depression   just think positive always and take your med
I have psychosis as well   I have a bipolar component to my illness as well   I know exactly what it be to have to try to function with those thing in and around you   all I know be thatwhen you get the right med with the right doctornp as I have your functioning go up   it can be crippling and people do not care   of course they will tell you to snap out of it   it be because you be the uncomfoable truth that they would rather ignore and sweep under the carpet
I would suggest see a therapist and a psychiatristi have intense depression and anxiety and bpd and autism and a few other thing I feel like I be all alone too   I   just stae with a new therapist cuz   I move to a new living   environment        in may or april and I just get a therapist in august   just two week ago   I have maybe two friend who understand my struggle but my parent do not get it at all they   say it be act out or attention seek    they tell I there be nothing wrong and I should not feel that way   some of my family say why can not I just be happy and they want a happy sister   they say do not sweat the small stuff   and it be no big deal   they say I be exaggerate they never have   understand it   they think it be bs   my family want I to snap out of it to   I be not on med which make it almost impossible to cope and livei feel like I be definitely bout to lose it and go off the deep end I think I already have
my story be similar to this I have severe anxiety that often time it cripple I my family be like just breathe yeah well it be not that easy I suffer from major depression too and spend a lot of time in bed it be the only place I feel safe
m its so hard when you suffer from mental illness iam in my   and still struggle day to day to keep it together
hi I have be where you be right now when people do not understand they be afraid of all the stupid stigma about we there be suppo group they be really helpful and some community have casual drop in place and you will see that other there be great people

the bipolar disorder survival guide by david j miklos it   phd and mind and emotion by matthew mckay phd patrick fanning and patricia zurich on a psychological   have help I along with what you mention I also have severe adhd ptsd and panic attack fetzima have also help a lot as well I have racing thought
as far as keep your duck in a row you need to keep a notebook write down info about med mood etc whatever be relevant to you it will help a lot   and for suppo I would suggest join a few bipolar suppo group on facebook it be amazingly helpful to have a group of people who understand your struggle   good wish to you xxx

that depend on your individual disability   for I she help with my cptsd depression and bipolar I train she to help by watch my back so no one can spook I she ale and respond to my raise anxiety interrupt depressive episode and respond to rise manic episode
distraction when I get like this I be my own bad enemy what I find good be to take myself out of my head until the phase pass last christmas I be the same way   I be do sound stupid but I colour every time the thought overwhelm I the distraction allow I time out of my own head until the adjustment in med kick in please know that the world be not well off without you xxx
be prepare for the weird look and the I be not look for anything serious excuse but you have to tell they as soon as possible otherwise they might break you out of ignorance spite or scorn they might also make you feel guilty you do not want any of that you need someone who understand or with an openmind to accept to understand your situation these be very rare as for I I time the people who stay   week and then they disappear completely
I would live in the moment especially as you be well enough to date at the moment if you experience any symptom during your couship live in the moment then and talk about it if you feel you be have an episode and if you be unwell remove yourself from each other until your feeling well that be I you can not predict the future and you need to get to know each other first do not scare they off we all have period of normality and who know if your happy it may not be an issue sometimes self disclosure be well keep to a minimum all the good          
I always tell people that be interested in be friend with I or romantically envolve with I at the beginning so they will understand the reason for my action or I need my personal space when one do not know it be always quick to judge that they be insane and you will be surprise on how many suffer the same thing but to embarrass to talk about it until the other talk about it first
you have to be honest otherwise keep it in will only make you bad by worry about it
I have never really date so I do not know how that work I have never be in a relationship with someone who be not a friend first even if there have always be a romantic intent from the beginning by my own choosing I feel more confident in a person if I know they as a friend therefore my previous paner all know about my mental health issue a long time before they step into a romantic relationship with I   what you need to be prepare for be that sometimes even the most well intentione people will not understand the truth of how these issue will effect both of you and your relationship you can give full and honest disclosure yet the rise coloured blur of new love will sometimes cloud a new paner judgement make they think that love conquer all and then when the dark and honest truth unveil itself it come as a shock or a nasty scare do not blame yourself for that allow both you and your paner everything you need to learn how to deal with it together and how to look after yourself through the up and down x
I agree none of their bussiness till after a few date and you feel you can trust they not to take advantage of you till then if you feel the funk come on and they want to see you just avoid it I have experiance when someone know right off the bat it have not turn out well be take advantage of play game with my head like I have to question my action run for the hill and the guy I wait to tell have say I never notice the nice one I would say really I be bat shit crazy the whole time I would be with they I would fight the head chatter and seroquel I could not take or I would take a nap but now I just figure its to much a pain I attract toxic people so if some nice man come my way great if not o well

I have bp and ptsd I have be on a lot of med over the year the   thing that I have learn be just because something work for someone else it do not mean it will for you all our chemical makeup be different and we all metabolize thing differently it take a long time for I to find a good balance but I still have period where I need extra med when my regular do not hold quite enough and I spiral down or sta get a bit out of control luckily I have have this disease long enough to be able to recognize the sign usually and to get help before I be in troublei have be on topomax for about   year now for both migraine and the bp and at a high do have have pretty good control with the bp I only wish it work as well on the migraine I also take cymbalta for fibro and the migraine if I begin to feel that I be have issue with the bp my doc place I on lithium er mg for a sho period to help I get through or adve any crisisi also take anti anxiety med due to the ptsd I hope this help you some I have be through many doctor and the good thing I can tell you be to stay inform know what med be out there what there side effect be and what be available to you on your in if you do not have in a lot of the pharmacy like walmas   list have list of medication that be a reduce priceor there be prescription discount card that will help knock down the price of you script you simply put in the name of the drug in their search engine and it tell you which pharmacy will be cheap and it give you a coupon to print for that price if it have not be for that program last year me rx my family would not have be able to have get half of our med we need and it cost nothing to paicipate good luck to you
I have be on lithium for over   year and it have make a world of difference I will not change it I be also on paxil to help with depression I still have my mood but bit as bad as when I be unmedicate also take adivan for stress and nerve help with anxiety and panic attack

the past be not woh worre about its go you have no fuure if you be live in the past be what get I out of it if you have like a record from your past that always run in your head write it down you can worry about the future you do not know what it be do not fear it you can write out your plan for the week let it go you can always make goal for the future and write it down I write stuff down because like you my head be pack with confusing stuff I have no way to change or predict I hope this make sense sometimes I do not even make sense to myself lol
I too I have try to talk to my doc and therapist but no one realize just how desperate I be for real sleep without the vivid and chaotic dream that leave I even more exhausted
it be not uncommon for medication to stop work as effectively over time   your body becomes habituate to the med and you need something else to help control symptom   you may also be under more stress in your life than you realize right now   stress definitely can have an effect on how well your medication work   talk to your doctor   sound to I that your anxiety be what be not be control as well right now   your doctor may be able to give you something else for your anxiety that might work well for you right now   anxiety definitely can result in irritability   my husband be that wayif he get anxious he can get irritable and aggressively grumpy   please explain to your family and friend that you definitely do not mean it   you love they and you be sorry if you hu they   you need your medication adjust   if you explain and apologize they may be willing to let it all go    and you may need to find another jobsomething that be a well fit for you personally and that do not because you to feel paralyze fear    my good wish be with you
it be such a destructive illness and everything be so much more complicated in a relationship where bipolar be present I know as I be the paner in one love a paner with bipolar be difficult the bipolar turn they into somebody that you do not recognize somebody that be not the real person you fall in love with instead of be an equal paner in a relationship you be expect to be a carer when they suffer depression and you have to suffer the emotional abuse often on the other end of the scale bipolar have rob I of all my trust in my relationship but I be hang in there perhaps your paner be afraid to face the bipolar situation afraid that he have lose the person he love it be lonely be the paner of a sufferer I sometimes feel alone when I be sit in the same room as my wife escapism to a ceain degree be natural who do not want to escape the one thing that worry and stress they out the most us guy just want to take care of our love one and family but when I feel there be nothing I can do I feel wohless and not up to the task a failure that can be destructive mental illness be not fair bipolar be not fair I would recommend return to counselling and also for both of you to learn more on bipolar together I find go over literature together help even repetitively as it refresh what the illness be and what it do I constantly strain to separate the illness from the person good luck
I too be bipolar along with schizoeffect anexity and paranoid disorder I be unable to work full time due to the schizoeffect I constantly think someone be watch I or try to hu I my suppo system be my mom brother therapist and psychiatrist I take my med as prescribe I do not adveise my illness so not too many people kno I do not go out often ether but since I live with my family they do not push they ask if I want to go do something if I say no they do not pressure they ask I if I want to go somewhere with they no one will ever understand bipolar unless they go through it in my opinion
you do not know I but somehow I end up here ditto to your story I live a lifetime of struggle and try to figure out what be wrong with I then someone send I this and I realize that if one single person would take the time to send I this then I be go to survive the mess be they because unless they live it they will never know it we be go to be ok for we because we have to be     liliana
guilty
it be a daily struggle for I to contain my bitchiness
claire jenkin like how we both react to this so true     everyday struggle

bonnielee guilty       
I struggle with some of those thing to   I have bpd and depression anxiety   I have very intense wohlessness I feel completely mentally drain   I be so close to end it all   I can relate to a lot of   what you be go thru
if I may ask what medication be you on I be on zyprexa prozac and lamictal and do you go to therapy not just a psychiatrist I have be where you be at and it be horrible feeling the good I know to do be to keep go to therapy and get my thought and my feeling out
some people just can not comprehend how bad the depression and anxiety hu and the judgement that I get from a job be to much for I I be disabled because of my illness and it be so hard to getn people to understand
contrary to what people be say about he not be the one I can say from experience that it be not necessarily true my boyfriend never understand depression or anxiety until I staed sharing material with he endless material about other experience whether they share my disability or have something else the mighty have plenty of aicle that be well write and relateable if he be willing to read and learn and most of all listen continue to try we also staed couple therapy at   year and it have really help he see how much he rely on I while he be away at work and just how big my hea be how much work I do w his kid and just how hard I struggle every day to get up and get by if there be a system and a way to help he see there be hope however if he be not willing to try to learn to listen to talk to help and understand then that be when you need to walk away for your own well be
I be so sorry you be go thru this   I have bipolar   also and anxiety for ten year and have be marry for   year   my husband will say sometimes I want my debbie back   this hus because I have never stop be debbie   just now I have a battle everyday live with this disease   but that be the catch you have it and you have to do what be good for you no matter who do not understand   a big pa of mental illness be do what be necessary to help control the symptom   I will pray you find peace for you and your bf   put please take care of you first
I ache for you   it be hard because he do not understand your desire to stay shuttered in your down time and you can not easily force yourself to go out   my wife of   year want nothing more than to sit home and watch movie live life vicariously because of severe social anxiety   we have come to a compromise   I have recently discover an interest in theater so that be my outlet and her love of movie and theater give she the oppounity to get out and come see what I be do
so my hubby and I be both bipolar it be not easy relationship be hard work that say if your bf be not suppoive or willing to work with you make compromise then you will be miserable but I also want to say be around people who be not bipolar be impoant in your journey to be independent and well maybe find some book do some research find what work for you find a distraction from the negative will help you out of those odd anxious feeling I personally believe that diet sleep exercise hydration and supplement help so much with regulate your body and brain chemistry I find that bih control caffeine sugar and synthetic dye all affect my mood negatively where ever you be on your journey you can always improve your experience with knowledge and personal trail and error do not let anyone bring you down or put you in an uncomfoable situation just for they be own sake your woh stay home for
I would like to say it mean he be not the one I have a relationship like that I feel guilty for want to stay home always and do not want to bore my gf you just get to find people and friend who take care of those quirk you have regardless of the mental disorder you be a human and have right to your feeling
I agree you do not need all that pull you down when you be already struggle x
he obviously do not care how you feel let alone he will never understand you I be sorry you struggle this way and I know just how difficult it can be I be sorry for he throw away someone so special take care be strong and remember you be not alone
I think you be react to the word imbecile well if he do not understand the point I believe he have little to no understanding of the need of people diagnose with mental illness you maybe do not understand the daily myth and stereotype that I and other deal with everyday because other do not understand thepoint education of society be the overall point but daily to find suppo can be exceedingly difficult so what be your point word too big maybe stupid idiot or dumb would help you understand because I do not believe you get the point either if you do not believe people with a mental illness typically be isolate in society desperately need suppo from people who have experience the degradation of these illness and can be helpful and insightful
I do not know I struggle with it everyday my mom be in my living room in a hospital bed on hospice I know they r slowly kill she with morphine I do not see the point in her suffer y do god do this to people y be not there a cure for cancer y do the good die young no point in life my mom be   her mom die at   of lung cancer n now she be face the same struggle when she go I want to jump in the hole with she because really what the hell be the point
there be no point when you stop look for the point to everything you learn to enjoy the good time more and let go of the bad when I realize this I stop feel so stressed and stop feel like a failure no point just wonderful messy life

there be some med that be consider safe while breastfeed that I try first I wait until she be   month because I be so worried about it do more harm than good but I could not handle the depression anymore   they take the edge off but be not super effective so once I stop breastfeed we go back to med that have work in the past   it all work out in the end   
I stop my med when we staed try to get pregnant and stay off of they until about   month pp due to breastfeed it be rough to say the least but we all get through it   I hadhave post paum depression which have make be off med for bipolarptsdanxietydepression much bad but we be work to get back on the right med and I be do a lot well hang in there   once you have your little bundle of joy and sta feel more like yourself it will all be woh itjust take it one day at a time   good luck

ethan do you have a close friend a relative or a counselor that you can turn to in time of trouble   you should likely have a personal safety plan prepare meaning you have someone to go be with when you feel especially depressed vulnerable or suicidal   you definitely need to be see a doctor for your bipolar disorder if you be not already   it be an illness that need to be medically treat   you definitely can not change that by yourself   it be like think that if you have cancer or diabetes you could just change it by want to or think hard enough about it   that be not how it work   you probably know that bipolar disorder be usually cause by chemical imbalance in the brain   you need medication to help with get your brain chemistry back on a healthy midline for you your depression be probably cause you to have pervasive thought and think loop just in case you do not know what that be as many people would notthat be when you get the same awful negative thought and memory play over and over in your mind   you try to get away from they but they often be intrusive and disturbing   depression be bad about cause those   you sound like you might also have a bit of ptsd from be bully   all of those thing can be treat well and effectively   you need to see a doctor   if you be really think of run away or do anything damaging to yourself please seek out help at a hospital   there be people who can help you and who will care for you    and ethan I know this may be hard for you to believe right now but you never deserve to be bully   you do not ask for it   the bully be the one who be   in the wrongand not you   please do not take to hea anything they may have say about you   bully deliberately try to find something to hu their victim with   quite often they seem to know exactly where our vulnerability and insecurity lie and attack we there   here be the thingthey be in the wrong and I be sure the thing they say about you be cruel awful and negative   I do not know you personally but I do know that no oneand I mean thisno one deserve to be treat like that   please do not let they keep bully you even now in your mind   whenever those thought and memory come back into your mind try to confront they   try to explain to yourself why those thing be incorrect or why those people be wrong about you   rebuild your inner strength by focus on all the good that I be sure exist in you and all the good you have do in your life   those bully do not know the real youthe one deep inside   only you and those close to you really know you   so do not let these bully and their stupid hatefulness steal another moment of your life from you    please get yourself some help for your bipolar and depression   those can be treat and you might find all those negative thought and memory eventually fade with treatment you have only my very good wish for a well future

I have be clean for   month now and I have cut for year I have stop before but I could not keep that go for I selfharm be a way to quiet the war inside my head and body but I also use it as punishment now two month ago I look at my scar and they be bad and think it have be enough I do not know something click which I do not have before I want to quit for myself and no one else but I still find it extremely difficult because when I feel bad and I be tense my mind automatically go to selfharm but what kind of help I may be weird but I look at picture of selfharm and while I do that the urge subside and I also have a buddy system I have one person who know about it and that I want to quit and ask she to help I in a way that I can call or message she when the urge be really strong but I find that the buddy system be a hard thing for I to do since its a huge step to ask for help and what also help I be that I do not want to be to harsh on myself I say to myself that its okay if I relapse someday that might happen it kind of take the pressure away a bit that help I when I quit cannabis too just know you be not alone and you can message I if you want to

I stop because I have child and be worried if anyone tell it would be possible I might get my baby take away I have   niece and I have see the mark on all of they and I feel guilty like I be a bad influence on they I have scar and it be embarrassing for I the good advice I can give be to talk to someone you trust who will not be all judgemental on you someone who will let you het your emotion out so you do not feel the need to take it out on yourself therapy really help too but it seem that may be an issue for you financially maybe look up a suppo group for help then also in therapy they teach you cope method of thing to help you keep from harm yourself exp journale listen to music go for a walk do some a work or call a friend whatever help you personally every one be different good luck to you redhea

I have be battle depressionanxietybipolar   and a host of mental illness most of my   year of life   I can sit here and tell you inspire word and story to make you temporarily feel well but the unfounate truth be that our mind be so damn stubborn that it will not last   for I music find mean purpose and ultimately an abundance of hope be key to make what feel like to I a recovery of sos or at least to be able to manage and control my mind more so than my mind control I   I do not know what that be for you but never stop be curious and wonder about the truth and all the mystery life have to offer it be truly boundless   for I it be this realization that humanity be one and through democracy and engaging one self in what provide you mean purpose and hope that I be able to conquer my mind   I think it boil down to perspective and dwell in future possibility along with suppo from family friend therapist doctor and medication   it take year to find the right balance of suppo but I can tell you that once you make it through your hell heaven await on the other side   I know I be talk in vague term but this be how my mind work and like any other muscle in the body if we train it well the mind can become our most valuable asset instead of our bad enemy   although I do not know you I have hope that you will overcome your demon and come out incredibly strong for it I hope that one day you come to realize this balance and be able to see and feel the positivity that many people bring to this world you be not alone in your darkness

I take   mg trintellix daily but do not have bipolar I have ptsd anxiety and depression
I can not really tell if it be work or not to tell you the truth I be on   other med for anxiety I can tell those work
neurotin gabapinten be not high enough to help with anxiety
completely understand I could not go without my med I be always try to get the right combination have struggle for year hope I will get there one day
doctor do not know how any drug will affect a patient as they affect everyone differently   they throw drug at you in hope something might work   we all need to do our own research which be incredibly hard when one be struggle   I have find the anti depressant to be very severely debilitate and do not take they anymore   if you be bipolar the first med to try be lithium at a low dose about   mg and work up every other week please do not just take thing because a doctor tell you to   honestly I have learn many of they do not have a clue and can cause huge issue in someone   trust your gut   I think your doctor sound frustrated that he have not be able to help you and be reach at straw to try another answer   I would try another doctor or two
I be treat for major depression disorder for year mostly by my gp after I stae see a psychiatrist I be give a questionnaire to fill out then she diagnose I bipolar base on those question we try several med over a period of time I have be on my current program for several year I take mg seroquel and mg viibryd I be also on pain med for fibromyalgia I take neurontin gabapentin mgs twice a day for nerve pain ultram tramdol mgs twice a day for muscle pain celebrex mgs once a day for inflammation and I have klonopin   as need not everyday for anxiety and skelaxin as a muscle relaxer as need not everyday it be a long list but it be for two diagnosis and the fibro have a long list of symptom since researcher have not decisively figure out what cause the fibro you can only treat the symptom
celexa be horrid horrid horrid for I and gabapentin be useless
oh no iv to sta seriquel on the nd for bipolar like yourself I have be getting treat for ptsd n anxiety disorder but like urself I be now tell iv get bipolar disorder can you tell I if the seroquel give you the palpitation thank x
I really feel for you as I have have a similar experience be be treat for year for major depression ptsd anxiety I be on a shit load of medication and then I move to a new state see a new psychiatrist who diagnose bipolar and staed I on new med but at the same time wean I off the old one I actually feel much well and have not have to be admit into hospital for over a year which be a miracle for I I spend   long year in and out of hospital have long bout of electric shock therapy and my body so pump up with drug that I literally could not move I be not live I be just exist seek other opinion from independent psych if you can I truly wish you all the very good on your journey to well mental health care   
be gabapenten generic for nerotin I take that with seroquell and they both help I alot I have to give it time to be therapeutic but after a couple month with the new doctor my anxiety go down but pill can only do so much right I be sick of pill hand full in the morning handful at night if I do not I make a happy trip to the hospital
my doctor switch I to brintellix once and give I sample to take home then when I try to get my rx fill my insurance would not cover it because there be cheap alternative so I have to switch back again whole thing be a waste of time and horrible on my body to just switch back and foh like that smh
everybodys system be different I have a sensitive system so my dr be very conservative as to any change I would definitely see your dr to let they how you have react your concern pa of your anxiety maybe because of your recent knowledge of your diagnosis
neurontin work wonder for my anxiety though
seroquel make I anxious even at low dose
secondly med only do half the work   you need tool to deal with you anxiety cbt be very good
do not worry about the bipolar diagnosis   lot of depression be actually bipolar but undiagnosed    it be easy to deal with once you know what you have and get on the right drug   get off any drug that give bad side effect as soon as possible though
because I be suppose to be on neurontin for my nmo which be an autoimmune disease like ms but bad I be also bipolar have depression   anxiety
first of all that seroquel be not go to do crap at only mg I take   depend on the day the seroquel help I cut my xanex need in half so I do not get anxious as easily I have try everything for about a   year period with no success until I stae a mood stabilizer I be bipolar and it be all I need
my psychiatrist want I to sta seroquel and I be petrifiedhad horrendous reaction to geodon w lomictal last fall during my st psych hospitalization last fall at   yrs old for my st mania last about   month include cut which I have not do since   yrs oldthey take I off geodon and lomictal xanaxcitalopramnow on clonazepam and miazapine but severely deppresse and do not know what to doso scared to sta more medsalso have psychotic reaction to prozac about   yrs agoi also have cirrhosis of the liver and most med have liver warning but all of my psychiatrist do not seem to worry about thisstuck in a dark room and do not know how to get outdeppresse all my lifesurvivor of severe long term childhood traumaptsd still not sure if I be bipolaranyone try cbd oil with any successany feedback appreciatedi can not seem to crawl out of this holefrozen in fear
I take mg of seroquel once a day and   mg of trazodone and as soon as I stae the seroquel I have bad anxiety attack   panic attack   even attempt to commit suicide but everybody be different it bother some people and some it do not
I take seroquel and it give I terrible panic attack everyone have their own reaction to each drug what work for I may not work for you goos luck
with bipolar if you tend to be depress the majority of the time it be often misdiagnose as major depression   I have have some doctor for sho period of time because of their shosidedness that argue with I that I do not have bipolar because they have not witness any maniahypomania in the   visit over   week they have be see I    the only medication you mention that I do not know much about be the neurontin   the other you be on should not have any adverse reaction with each other but that do not mean you will not have adverse reaction to they   the dose of the other you be on be fairly low dose   if you have be on they for several week at least and be still have the panic and other side effect talk to your doctor about adjust dosage   if you have just stae on they give it a few week unless the symptom get unbearablelife threaten for your body to adjust to they   it be very possible this just be not a good combination for you   nothing but time and trial and error can figure out what will work
trial and error diagnose at   major depressive bipolar and bpd also anxiety disorder and post traumatic stress disorder last year speak to your doctor again explain everything and possibly see a psychiatrist although I be assume after have your diagnosis you may already be in touch with one already   I be now   and truly trial and error everyone react differently to medication good luck
I doubt that be alone way to long seem law of average would have come in by now ha
  always panic attack so strong I almost fainttightness of the chest a mix of ptsd large group or new situation with large group be overwhelming
would probably say number   I do find it hard to concentrate feel tired sometimes and suffer with anxiety if I need to do something different or have to attend something that I be not comfoable with
yesthat be I I worry about othersbut talk about mine

eliminate trigger be industrious take medication if you need it but do not use your illness or med as an excuse and make other responsible for your condition   go to work the less time you have to think about thing the less mania that can result and also people only give people the benefit of the doubt when you be well from my personal experience   stand up do not be a victim and if you need med take they regardless of anyone poor judgement whatever if you eliminate trigger you be as normal as anyone else take care
I think a lot of time parent have a hard time accept their child have mental health issue because they feel like it be their fault or they be be blame or like they do something wrong so they will try to deny or ignore thing like this also it be hard to understand what someone else be go through unless you walk a mile in their shoe so to speak I have bipolar and anxiety issue etc I have a close family member tell I that they never believe anxiety attack be real until they have one their self that same family member get on medication and never tell I about it I think she be embarrassed because she have secretly judge I for so long and it be too hard for she to admit that she be wrong
explain to she that diabetic need to take med for life people with high blood pressure or hea problem have to take med for life people who have have new organ like heas lung kidney skin have to take anti rejection drug every day of their life and you do too otherwise in one way or another you will die some people choose not to understand that the brain be another organ and can be chemically different cause illness just like liver failure cause illness
I have be on lithium for   yrs as well as my anxiety med   be   I be also   month pregnant which mean have to stop all med while pregnant I be bipolarmanic depressive with severe anxiety I be on my med so long I do not and to be honest I still do not know how to function without they it be be a total shit of a nightmare without they I have side effect and withdrawal from not take they my depression have take over my entire pregnancy and life I have   week leave and count the day until I can get back on my med so I be not only ask but beg you to not stop take your med sorry so long
not go out it pa of be mentally ill I be in utah and be tell because I be not follow the gospel be all my problem be a addict and mentally be ok you need to just try to treat both I do well just make sure no matter what I would not use drug I drop of the map no one I use drug with could find I in my new apt delete all their number and fully dedicadef no drug you will feel the most benifit of your med maybe want to go out or just feel well inside but do not ever let anyone judge you I be go to na but give I anxiety have friend that go I be put on adderal and she look down on I I think she be not in my head and blow she off
I would suggest family counseling so she can understand from a professional that it be a real illness and not just some attention seek behavior trust I if we could control it we sure as hell would med can helpsome do not but it take more than get outside the good advice be focus on get well and not how peopleeven family perceive your disorder you can only do what you can each day put one foot in front of the other and take a step forward no matter how small remember you be not alone there be many of we who suffer in silence and shame I be learn to become okay with be myself hug
honestly in my experience you can educate people but you can not force they to accept that knowledge or not either they will try to understand or they will not and if they will not do not stress yourself out over it because that be not your fault you can only ask that they respect your boundary and not discuss it because it be an upsetting or trigger topic   the old adage be true you can lead a horse to water but you can not make it drink
I know this feeling so well my dad do kind of the same thing I know a lot of it be from the generation he be raise in and the lack of mental awareness to the general population then and now I have coworker friend family who also just do not understand it can be very huful at time or even down right embarrassing for I to try and explain but I know it be not the fact that they will not understand it be just that they can not how can they truly understand what I be live with when they have never have to deal with it themselves even other people with the same disorder can vary in functionality and how they feel about the disorder because of their own personal experience and sometimes we do not understand that they can not and we just have to remember everyone be at different level of understand another and be able to be okay with that and know that it be not our fault
I be on lithium and anxiety med too I have bipolar
hmmi doubt it will work in my case
oh yes it be fair I think she should walk the path of shame this time because sh deny her family once again for this kind of life and meher mom be the only one there for her   hr and he be off live in the street not worry about find a place for she to go to or suppoe she to stay clean just bring she back down after a year of soberity
erm how about tell she no fucking way she choose this life she need to deal with it she should have think about that before she think she be in the book   shade of grey   its not fair to confuse your little boy xxx
my thought exactly she say yesterday if she do not get some money soon she will be force to move back to mine like I want that stress tell she to speak to her parent
this be what I want I keep read it and I have adhd this all seam so huge I get confused on how to do it all
I feel for you all my son have bipolar and I know his hard he struggle each dayxx
no you be not alone how about schedule a lay around do nothing day once it even twice a week rest take a break from the endless self battle and let the dish sit no tidying up not even get dress on other day when you just hate everything tell yourself I will take care of stuff today because thursday I can blow it all off no guilt we get to learn how to actually rest rather than crumple under the pressure we put on ourselves
I be have so much depression and anxiety but I never take any med
I be sure many of we as child look at other parent and think they be far cool than our own I guess it be human nature to think the grass be always green    unfounately mental illness be not nice for any love one to deal with especially for a child to understand   child unfounately can be very selfish it be not until a lot later that they learn to become selfless some unfounately never learn but I be sure that be not the case for you and your daughter I be sure that however hard it be for she now she will learn to accept understand and as she mature I be sure she will become a far more tolerant and caring person because of it as other have suggest I be sure what she really mean be that she wish you be well that you do not have to suffer and that she do not have to see you suffer I be sure she love you very much but it must be so hard for she to understand and comprehend why you can not get well we as sufferer do not often understand it because it usually do not make sense so how can a child child can at time be insensitive and huful but it can simply be because they do not have the maturity or insight to know otherwise   I be sure you have come across many adult who can be far more intolerant and insensitive my husband do not get it but then again I do not think he want to   your daughter be a young girl she have an excuse bless she I be sure it be not easy for you   I be sure probably another day she will completely forget that flippant remark and tell you how much she love you you be do all the right thing to get well try not to dwell on this xx
hey there accept the help of family and friend they love you find out from your doctor about find a suppo program for woman in your situation be vocal about any scary thought that come up the baby grow inside of you be a blessing
I battle with on a daily basis I do not take med even though I do be need it at time but somehow I manage this monster that be inside of I yea I find myself cry a lot and do not even know why I shake it off of I and keep a pushing
you will struggle n it will drive you crazy some time but if you keep it it will be the good thing you ve ever have they will love you n you will love they but its up to you but stay strong n do not let anyone push you either way n as for the father if he do not want to help he do not know what his miss stay strong bub
your feeling be valid have a child can be overwhelming and scary even with help from the father and medication if you decide to keep the baby there will be challenge no matter what it can also reward in way you can not imagine pregnancy be different for everyone however I cry all the time even for happy thing I worry about everything I think I be incapable of be a good mom I never ask for help either   year later I still have trouble ask for help even though my friend be more than willing I believe you can do this   if you want to it be also ok to look at adoption if you do not I personally do not think aboion be right but it be also an option if the baby be not too far along I be not here to judge no matter what you choose you must do what be right for you and you need to take care of yourself I do take an antidepressant during pregnancy and go to a therapist actually I still do both hide all this only cause you to suffer more when I staed therapy and staed be open with my friend and family I find that several of they also have depression and anxiety and also need help or emotional suppo as mother not all of they but a good chunk all of a sudden I realize I have an entire suppo system right in front of I
if you have never officially be diagnose with depression or anxiety I be guess that mean you have never be give therapy or medication to help please please please get to a doctor as soon as possible and tell they how you be feel pregnancy hormone definitely intensify emotion and you can get much needed help from a good doctor if the first doctor do not help or do not take you seriously go to another and another until you find one who do your life and your child life be valuable
I feel for you so much can you not go to your doc or speak to a midwife I suffer too and when I be have my baby feel the same wayi manage to open up about this to my midwife and she note everything down in my note they keep a really good check on I right through my pregnancy once I give bih they put I on medication straight away please open up it be nothing to be ashamed about you would be surprise the amount of people and new mother out there that feel the same way also once my child be bear and put in my arm the love you will have will surprise you it will be hard but there be a lot off suppo out there please open up and talk to someone god bless you x x
honestly you be not be dramatic about it your feeling be real you do not have to continue suffer like this there be help for you I know its real hard to ask for it when you be independent I suffer for year without any help from anyone and it get so bad I just have to say something I be on a mood stabiliser and anti depressant before my pregnancy and they be both take away for the first   week and then I be allow my mood stabiliser after   week but not the anti depressant please see a doctor they will prescribe something to you if the benefit of medication outweigh the con you really do need to be monitor to make sure you be not go to get any bad and I be high risk post natal depression if you talk to your family they can keep an eye on you after the baby be bear a doctor can refer you to counsel too you may find it easy to talk about how you really feel with a stranger I wish you all the luck xx
you can do this be pregnant intensifys every thing emotionally ect your scared because it sound the father of the baby be no suppo to you find the people who care an love you an talk to they it be scary be a first time mother but your child be a blessing an you child can change you entire world for the well keep your head up
I be sure that must often be the case with mental illness be it anxiety or depression or other illness it be really good that you can take note of the sign and use they as a warning   I think people who be in a period of recovery and have learn how to notice sign of decline trigger if you like and can then engage preventative measure to make sure you do not continue to spiral downward but this might only be possible for people who have spend year and month work thorough all of this I be try to remember all the physical symptom I remember of severe depression I constantly have this almost sore throat it be not sore but I be always aware of this unpleasant sensation a tightness all to do with the anxiety of feel depressed and not be able to escape the nausea tightness in my chest unsettled stomach lethargy no appetite some of these thing you could almost argue be not actually physical but psychological but feel physicalweird the first time I have a panic attack I honestly think I be have a hea attack and I be no way a drama queen or a hypochondriac   yes whether it be a mental physical symptom they can be so closely link and often chicken and egg one can lead to another and vice versa but yes I think stress in general can cause so many physical symptom most very unpleasant   that be why alone it be so impoant to look after yourself eat well sit in the sunshine and to do some light exercise if you can xx

lesson number one never tell employer your mental illness they will capitalize on it   like they do mock your illness by say it be too stressful trust I   let they know your doctor give you time off for medical reason but that be it
I have be diagnose with both bipolar     I have mix manic episode I have struggle with the depression pa of it for year   be relatively oblivious to be manic because it be the close to normal I have be able to feel I only recognize the symptom now since I have be diagnose   educate about this debilitate disorder beforehand I just think I be extremely depressed I can relate to what you be go through I remember many day of not be able to get out of bed to shower or get dress all I feel like do be cry   sleep I could not eat   have to interact with another human being be a live nightmare I try many different medication until I finally find one that make a difference not all medication affect people in the same way so it be impoant to work with a mental health physician to figure out what work well for you I be not go to say medication be a fix all but it definitely do decrease symptom   make life more bearable   woh live again get enough rest be also just as equally impoant sometimes during a manic   episode sleep may seem impossible   there be medication available to help with that but personally I choose melatonin which be all natural above all just try your good to stay positive   on your bad day remind yourself   this too shall pass a good suppo group or just one person you can trust   talk to when you be have a low also benefit greatly   hope this help encourage you to keep push forward

citalopram and its sister tablet escitalopram be not as severe as most of the other ssris out there in paicular seraline lustral seroxat paroxetine   paxil and anafranil   citalopram take the edge off the issue and the anxiety   panic but it still allow you to function normally seraline and seroxat can also because libido problem in man and woman
propranolol be fab   it save my life simple it just stop my blood pressure rise which prevent my anxiety from get out of control   it just   stop it be like flick a switch   bliss I take one every morning and it get rid of   conservatively speak   at least half my anxiety symptom on a normal day I experience almost no noticeable symptom whatsoever of course some day be more stressful than other and some situation be more stressful than other   so if I know I be go somewhere that I be not go to like very much then a very low dose of diazepam take care of most of the other symptom I can work I can play I can have a life I teach   I can stand up in front of a class   when I be at my bad I could barely leave the house propranolol bring I back I be a fancaveat my anxiety be relate to the bp and combatrelate ptsd so advice may vary accord to circumstance   however the propranolol help nicely with the hypomania from the bp   and the hypervigilance of the ptsd
I get reject and wish I have never apply I become very anxious during the application and assessment period one of the reason I give be that ihad a good understanding of my illness I have bpd no shit sherlock I have have to live with this for   year of course I have research and read about my illness
irritable bowel syndrome
I have depression severe anxiety and ptsd be diagnose with all three for well over a decade and I still get up every morning monfri to go to work   why   because that be what adult do   you ought to try to find a job that fit you rather than decide at   that you will spend the rest of your life of disability   I be not try to be mean when I say this but damn   do not let the disease define you
I think that be a hiif idea the way the other comment be say do not sound like a nice suggestion people can only do so much without be overwhelmed ease into thing be the well way if a person can
I have suggest to somebody I know who have ocd anxiety and depression to try volunteer in a shop for either mind bhf pdsa the red cross etc just for the social element and for the experience of work in the hope that one day maybe they could use whichever skill they have gain in volunteering and apply for a pay job be it patime or otherwise   this would give they something to look forward to and hopefully help they build up their selfesteem in the long run have a volunteer job to begin with be a good sta and it would not affect the benefit claim   I try to explain all this to the person mother but she do not approve   I really do not know why when it would serve as a constructive purpose and none of the benefit would be harm   in fact the dwp   employment centre   local council would applaud the effo in try to do something positive
I be go to try for disability until my lawyer say it be a   month waiting period and an additional   month just to get a decision that be over   year of wait um no thank you I would rather work than be break and loose every thing work be difficult with bp and anxiety I understand that but it be not impossible it be just find a job that you can do that fit you
like many have already say everyone be circumstance be different and we should not judge it be difficult to work if you be constantly have panic attack can not focus on task or on what your boss be say freeze up when people speak to you etc disability may or may not be a permanent thing but age be not always an indicator of how ready or capable someone be of work also with age can come an understanding and growth of cope mechanism and medication adjustment that could lead to be able to work someday but she need money in the meantime yeah just say just because she be young do not mean she be more capable of overcome her disability and in this case it may actually work against she I do agree she should not give up hope of work someday but act like she be immature because she struggle with debilitate mental illness be very condescend and show a lack of empathy and understanding that not everyone be like you and just because you havehad it bad do not mean there be not someone who have it bad
I use to work full time but I have to change to pa time because I be so mentally exhausted and be have panic attack as soon as I clock out I take   week off of work to rest you know what be good for you like you say everyone be different maybe you could try volunteer work when you sta to feel well
I also work night because I can not work with the public nor a lot of co worker and though I still have lot of anxiety and feel at time I want to pass out or hide I try to collect myself and keep go I have have my illness since I be   also and I be now   so we walk in different shoe but have some similar experience
I have be diagnose with literally the same exact thing plus panic disorder and be on disability since I be   but I lose my disability at age   and go almost   year without it or even a job because I believe the same thing when you have severe social anxiety and panic attack randomly you already know there be no way I would want to be around hella people and feel so miserable but on the inside I be also passionate about live life and have awesome fun precious moment with friend and family and I want what my friend have a life a life where you be exhausted but because of work not my disability I want to feel stress the kind about college not how I be go to survive mentally and physically   today or how I be go to ask mom for money to pay my phone bill I be miss out and I will be   on september nd I be a strong person I just have not try hard enough which hus kind of of to say because I believe I do try I try every damn day to wake up and be ok but most of the time my demon stop I and get the good of I but the last   month something click in april I lose my medical insurance and I have be go all this time without my pill I be on trazadone lamotrigine propranolol etc but I have be stay with my bfs mom and she be be such great help and I realize with a change of environment for I in my own case not suggest this work for everyone I have change completely a friend be help I get a pa time job and I could not be happy or more proud of myself for face my fear the point of this long comment be that I wish I do what I be try to do now when I be your age because I be get old and now it be go to take I long to be who I want to be do not make my mistake I have see people with bad case of paranoia schizophrenia and be amazing successful people speak in front of crowd and hallucinate at the same time but push it to the side to be able to do their job and you would never guess you can work with ptsd anxiety etc be it go to be easy no be you go to   mess up have an episode maybe even lose your job yeah to be honest but you get up take care of yourself first and try again I hope you see this as helpful and not judge or a negative comment because I promise it be not sorry for long comment lol emmajane naude
I be on permanent disability now after almost   year of drive myself into the ground however I have very severe bipolar bpd major anixety and panic disorder ptsd not say you should not apply for it but here in canada generally for just anxiety and ptsd they would not quailfy you for permanent disability just ppwd which be give for   year to help get your self ready for the world due to the severe trauma I suffer grow up and everything that happen and numerous suicide attempt and fight for help I get a new doc who immediately see how much I be suffer and get I on disability I also have a now   year old son whom I help raise with my inlaw due to the severity of my illness I would suggest stae with therapy maybe do a job few day a week and find other way to help you not say you do not quailfy for aid but your still very young and you may have a hard time be accept for such funding however like the one lady say every one be different I wish you the good
bonnie corbin what you say to she be absolutely horrible no two people have the history or personal level of any mental disorder and too suggest otherwise only show that you truly know nothing or truly do not understand mental illness to say what you insinuate on this page be horrible
I work night cus I can not deal with social situation I have bipolar anxiety complex ptsd and depression and the only thing that keep I same and give I a purpose be go to work
I have be work as a therapist for   year there be only   disorder I regularly treat yet no   client be ever the same   there be massively differ severity of the same condition range from functional when the person can work well to the other extreme where hospitalisation be need    there be time when I tell a client to keep work because the routine be good for their depression or the anxiety be manageable with suppo and avoidance would worsen the anxiety however there be also time when I would encourage someone to remove stress like work from their life so they can focus on get good at manage the basic   lot of people have the same diagnosis but treatment and advice will vary for the individual   pip application be difficult if you be able to get an advocate or advice from cab it may assist you in navigate the process   good wish to you emmajane naude
izzie radfordnash   say everyone here have mental illness so we understand your situation be completely untrue and destructive to say my ptsd anxiety depression etc experience be not identical to emmajane or anyone else nor be theirs identitcal to each other so yes you have some glimmer of insight into other live with the same condition but just because you fight similar demon do not mean you understand theirs
I have severe depression and anxiety and just turn   I have a job and do so agree with bonnie
emmajane   I have deal with aniexty and depression for year I get marry and then have a baby at   that be when the depression hit hard when my son be about   I get pregnant again still feel the same way when my middle be about   I take floral class just to get out of the house good decision I ever make work with flower for I be calm   year ago my teacher hire I to work at her flower shop I look forward to go to work because it be a stress reliever maybe do something that sound fun to do or take an a class in an adult school will help I be   now and I still have aniexty and depression but it be get well just find something that look like fun it could be hike as and craft etc good luck
I in now way shape or form devalue her situation or judge her experience I tell she that there be way of live with anxiety and not to give up you do not have to be a victim   I think it be absolutely absurd that doctor be so quick to tell a young woman who have just admit she be never even be to therapy that she should just give up on work and go on disability because she have anxiety    be I the only one who see the ridiculousness in this her anxiety will only increase if she give in to it and decide not to work before even go through therapy be just ludicrous to I
I find work help I I have to cope through anxiety attack in a safe environment gain more confidence and success in deal with the disorder help you to manage it well long term I have take two tour of europe be to mexico and many other trip do thing I never think I would do anxiety be uncomfoable but it be not dangerous be what I tell myself also rewire my thinking by study buddhism in paicular ajahn brahms book do not worry be grumpy work well than any kind of medication
I have have this since I be   both the anxiety and depression this have not be an easy decision for I I do not want to give up but even if I go on pip for a few year until I be mentally stable and ready for work then I will but for now it be what I believe be good I be wait to get an appointment for a counsellor but not hear anything back
you have so much life to live there be so many different treatment and thing you could be do to help cope with the anxiety   I be honestly appal the doctor would suggest it   have you see a psychiatrist
I be so sorry to hear that and I wish that I could give you some hope I have a congenital hea defect which be only find when I be   year old tell I be just a lazy unsociable child have some side effect with that low blood pressure blackout depression but have st pacemaker after the bih of my eld child now lot of year later janapril   have   pacemaker op due to complication have be treat for depression anxiety sociophobia   insomnia since my husband death   year ago and have to give up a lifetime job which I love   pip be stop in february cause many problem cab have be extraordinarily helpful in appeal and reappeale but say even if it be good news I will   hear nothing until october I feel guilty still know that this be be do to people who be die and I be lucky but it suck good luck to you and please get a suppo worker or go to citizen advice bureau           hug
I stop take propanolol because I do not feel that much of a difference when on it I still have anxiety attack and it be not help much for work it may work for you though everyone react differently to different medication all it do for I be slow my hea rate down a bit
I too it stop the shake and hea racing at first but I find it do not work as well later on it do not do anything for the brain whir I have be tell now to just take it as need
I find the propananolol help with the hea palp I have with my anxiety
propanolol be a bp med often use for anxiety by help to keep your bp low usually you need more of a dx to qualify for any assistance  
my neurologist would not prescribe propranolol to I as a migraine preventative because it can cause a low mooddepression I have major depressive disorder and anxiety
I have this for my anxiety get take off it due to pregnancy go from fairly function human be to not be able to leave the house most day    I have agoraphobia without it panic attack at the thought of be around people I can not sleep properly without it as my anxiety keep I awake pregabalin honestly change my life
it cause I all sos of problem I have drug induce narcolepsy and dementia it really really do not agree with I I sit in a meeting for a hour and panic   day later think I would miss it my paner be with I as say I fall asleep   time and keep forget what I be talk about then I score   on my pip what a joke
I have propanolol for anxiety
I would recommend it for anxiety I can not manage without it
pregabalin be a very hit and miss drug and I consider it still largly experimental in all field because there have not be many test do on it compare to most drug it be design for neuropathic pain it work somewhat for most anxiety not completely and be addictive despite expe opinion I have to ween off it because I get addict with side effect like euphoria and weight gain   to answer the questiom though yes you will likely gain a lot of weight most people do because it slow nerve transmission eventually slow metabolism
I have notcannot and will not let this beat I downi struggle everyday    
stigma be the big global social issue and hiv be one of the big global health issue   stigma affect race   religion   culture health status etc and we fall into one category hiv we be either hiv negative or positive   my self and my team member from around the globe be work on create the app that will help in curb this problem for million or maybe billion of people around the globe think you care so much about see a change in the world we need someone from this group we can talk to about depression and anxiety so help we tackle this problem well   I be also one but I need someone else accessment
see as how my job be develop technology I fear this day
it be so sad that you have be let down by your employer when you originally think she would be suppoive I be sure that have not help you at all I be hope your doctor be help you and you can visit again if you need to have he prescribe any medication to help if you be in the us I do not know the rule on employment it do not seem right that she be pressurise you to leave   only you can decide on what to do whether the job be right for you with mental illness we can blame ourselves and feel guilty it be really not your fault you do not choose to be like this   yes emotion can be all over the place it ceainly can be dreadful sometimes I hope you have people to help and suppo you lean on they xx
yeah you kind of put yourself in a corner say you want a job that be not so stressful I would sta look for one that be not as stressful and you will feel so much reilf I have a bad job I would cry before and cry after I be disabled and have a special paper fill out they could not fire I but I get a lot of shit and when the project close and I do not have the job I be amazed how great it be not have stress now I have a job that be so mellow I love it I wish you well and hope you find what be good for you
I know it be horrible be not it but we be strong than people think we get up and do it where some would not when they dint even have our problem remember we be strong and well than everyone else     x
thank you susan I have to be back on monday and already stress
do not ever feel guilty a job be a job your health be more impoant sound to I she be not as suppoive as she say she would be maybe some time off will not hu a new job a new sta may help I feel you I feel trap I feel too scared to try and move on so I continue to go to work unhappy I wish I could do what I be advise you to do
I be the same but frighten to change and worry that everything might go wrong I do not do change very well I be a creature of habit and change scare I maybe pa of my anxiety we have so many barrier to try and cross because of our illness but we should give ourselves a pat on the back because we actually get up and go to work it be such a hard thing to do for we but we do it I have try look for other work but when I see the application form my mind go blank and I have no idea what they be want I to say I talk myself out of it then and think I be not good enough for anything else hopefully one day day we have the strength to make the change good luck     x
it be genetic in our family my sister get it if you could make it past the age of   and not get it then you would not I be worried till   I have a list of other problem I just do not want that one to hopefully there will be betterb medication if the gen pop up in my great grand children life
I be wonder what be their reason for not believe you that be get to be really huful and hard to deal with you should be very proud of yourself for having make it this far without their suppo you be very strong for that as for advice candace could not have say it any well but I have a feeling something will happen to open their eye when you be patient and focus on better yourself instead of stress and fight everything else usually tend to fall in to place good luck I hope it work out for you
you have to let it go none of we be perfect and deal with bipolar or any mental issue be such a struggle people that do not have the daily struggle have no idea how hard it can be for we I be happy that you have finally find medication to help because sometimes I could take a lifetime but when you find that moment or you feel like yourself it be precious do not ever let anybody else diminish your shine light
I be go through something similar n just read through the comment have make I feel a little less guilty about cut people off be pa of this group have save I many time thanku   
yes people do not understand my family have a problem of everytime I get mad or upset its because I be mentally ill I hate it but I have to step back and keep tell myself they just do not like to be accountable for thi action and I know its not I because I can tell the difference when I be manic and just piss
if you have try every way you can think of to inform this person of what your condition be about I find the meme and such can be an easy and helpful way to explain thing sometimes and they just refuse to understand or believe you then to I they would be toxic and I would remove they from my life   if down the road they have educate themselves and want to be a positive impact on my life I would sta out slowly rebuild that relationship   I have lose a lot of friend and most of my family because they do not believe what bipolar disorderdepression and anxiety be   it be my opinion that those who truly love and care for you will make the effo to learn about the condition how to treat you and suppo you with your condition just as they would with anybody that have an invisible condition like hea disease lung disease etc   have a broken brain as I call it be serious and you do not need toxic people in your life   life be too sho and be stable be a hard place to get to   you want to enjoy be stable and have a life again   you can not do that with toxic people in your life   just my opinion
as long as you be feel more stable on your med try not to worry about what other people say or think your be more impoant it be hard enough cope without their negative input stay strong and keep look forward   
I have say this a thousand time before unless you have a diagnosis of mental illness or a doctor you will never understand the way the person feel I have lose so many sooo many people in my life cuz of my disorder over time my hea have harden although I try to love n connect with people you can not see it so to some it be not real or a cop out nobody want this or ask for this you have to be you n if they can not except you for you then you do not need they as much as it hus you have to put yourself first be open n honest n blunt tell they how you feel n if they can not respect that then you need to move on never be ashamed of who you be n have the strength to stand up for yourself there be plenty of people who will suppo you n remember you be not alone hope this help n although we do not know ea ch other I be allway here for those who struggle with mental illness
someone who be never be there will never empathize let alone be compassionate about your case unless they have the kind of golden hea that allow they to somewhat sympathize with you it might be hard at first but you should distance yourself from anything or anyone that make you feel angry sad or guilty these   emotion at high degree be the gateway to depression you need to find people that have be there and overcome it or learn to cope interact with other even online in a fb group be a good sta I would say   also this
do not worry about they some people you can never please focus on youredhea
it be completely her issue either shut up and move on or leave jeez have some empathy for she she be clearly struggle if not then gtfo
you can only do so much for someone before you finally throw your hand in the air it may be difficult more so because they be married but I can only imagine her stress to take all this on plus their unstable son eventually she have one option at the end of the road which be to take care of their son and herself as he will not do it with she might sound cold but I have be there with guy who be unsavable I have not be marry but as a woman struggle with bipolar and depression I have to walk away there be not much more I could do for they I have to take care of myself before I hit rock bottom with they
I have a sister who do not live a healthy productive lifeshe do not want to take medsget any kind of help and she cuss I daily after I just give she foodcoffeecigswhat ever she needsand not even a thank youif I do not give she cigsshe go into a manic fit scream and curse I do have neighborsshe hoard and have completely junk up a trailori let she stay inshe will not work at anythingalthough she go to nursing school to be a r nshe have bipolar schizophrenia and recently get in trouble I have to pay her fineshe put in the paper that she be not indigent but in realityshe do not have a pennie I can not claim she on taxeswe pay her bill I do not want to see she out in a ditchbut she be bring I down with hershe have no conciousand I have never see her cry she see dog peopleand talk to people not therei do not deserve this stress no one will help mental illness people
I have a couple of easy suggestion that I be able to do that help tremendously in regard to your ge try to find a free sho class to help you pass your ged they have they all over probably even online these day   or go to your local public library and study they be book for ged I think you might have to do it there but not sure and take the get practice test to see if there be anything on each one that you need to study or learn then take the practice test again before you go to take each ge test that way you get rid of any doubt or anxiety and save yourself some time   then go for it it look to I like you can do this so good luck with the new job when you get one

I think deep down many of we afflict already know we be the gifted allow to access pas of our brain housing telepathy and other th sense awareness capability   and that be why many of we war with depression and anxiety we share in the glory and agony of other who have the luxury of only be aware of themselves   our true design and purpose in a less increasingly and overwhelmingly selfish world be to help other understand themselves and how their vibe be affect the world around they

I do not   be the easy answer however as a bp then it be rarely lifethreatene if I miss a dose   unless I be in a depressive episode of course   in which case it be a little too late to worry about that since I be barely able to feed myself never mind remember my med

how can I   avoid over think
I allway over think n analyze everything too death I be on six different medication n none of they help this problem for I personally I shut my mind off by smoking weed it help with my mind n anxiety
breathe in for   second hold for   exhale for    that be the way I do it but that only help calm anxiety and do not really help my thinking   personally I drink a lot of whiskey and pop an opiate but I do not recommend that for anyone
I set an alarm on my phone
damn I wish that nobody have mental or emotional illness I understand you guy it be so difficult to deal with bipolar disorder and with depression on a day to day basis I just wish that nobody would suffer from that it be just horrible
this be so true   we have no choice but to be strong   we have to fight to do the simple thing   we battle so much unimaginable pain   and hu sadness and despair and sorrow it be a stuggle just to deal with everything   it be not for pussy that be for shure   I have be struggle for year   bout ready to give up   rather die then keep go
I lose weight on abilify I gain lbs on geodon zyprexa and seroquel over a   year period   take these med at different time my abilify dose go from to   mg depend on time of year and other factor I have be on abilify now for   year I be much more functional now side effect wise I tend to get nauseous very easily as well as an upset stomach and intestinal issue which my pdoc say may be the abilify
abilify do absolutely nothing butbmake I bad I have no energy on it the hallucination and paranoia get bad andso do the depression plus it cause I to have chest pain that be directly relate to the medication be combine with another med   I be only on it for   week but that be a miserable   week
I do not know some of my friend hallucinate and get paranoid and have do very well on it I just know it be not the med for I
ohh ok maybe it just be not good for people that have that and paranoia
I be on mg of abilify I have high blood pressure and increase sweating and have gain half a stone in   month but it be the good one I have have at stabilise I x
be on it for year gain over   lbs blood pressure increase need more med for that when blood sugar increase have to be take off before I become diabetic
you will probably find mixed result my doc just put I on abilify because I could not get out of bed my energy level be   now I have only be on it less than a week but I can get out of bed now still low on energy but I be feel it go up my doctor also know I be worried about weight gain as I be   lbs over weight and have   blow out disc in my back I can not gain anymore or I will be at a loss   she say for adult the old you be the more energy it will hopefully give you and should not gain any weight the young you be it will be just the opposite
my good mate be on abilify and he seem to be ok in the energy depament I mean he be probably tired for a while when they stae he on it but currently he do not seem to have any energy issue relate to medication his schizophrenia and anxiety cause tiredness but his level of tiredness be the same as prior to abilify
I think I have say this a thousand time before unless you have a diagnosis of mental illness or a doctor you will never understand the way the person feel somewhere along the line my hea have harden although my family be suppoive there be many who have leave I for dead in their life include my biological father nobody ask for this do not be ashamed of your tear you have every right to express your pain be blunt tell they exactly what they be do n how it make you feel if it continue you need to seek suppo somewhere else family should allway be there for you that be say respect yourself enough to get the suppo you deserve for the record I be bipolar   border line personality disorder and schizoaffective
do not feel guilty for your feeling   it be family they should embrace you as you be period
to have to struggle with myself so much you have to have a spine or grow nuts it be a survival mechanism it be always one thing or another brave I have to be
sleep deprivation and to much sleep be common you have to just roll with it   just understand you be not lazy and expect   and accept that   do not beat yourself up you be already struggle they say you have to force yourself up I really have try that and have a sun lamp helps take vitamind for you may be insufficient sound like you be not go thru the rem phase of sleep rapid eye movement you think you have sleep for eight hrs but when you wake you do not feel like you have sleep at all
hell my med change constantly if you do not understand why or how much of a medication you can call your provider and speak with their nurse or talk to your pharmacist my pharmacy give I an information printout on each med I take every time it be fill or refill I have bipolar severe mixed you be not alone I get paranoia and tend to be catastrophic and   have many trust issue you must become your own advocate accept help when you can ask if you wonder take care of yourself be   I have boy I raise when diagnose it be difficult but more freeing as child be more forgiving they do not need long or inappropriate information continue my love for they explain when mommy be not feel well now they be young man who understand my disease and freely love I do not overburden your child with language they would not understand please take care and love yourself and love and respect your child
I be bipolar have border line personality disorder n schizoaffective I be on mg of lamotrigine mg of depa kote mg of wellbutriuin mg of valium I take the lamotrigine n wellbutriuin in morning n other at night n suffer horrible insomnia my mind dosent let I sleep or shut down
I be have the same problem with lamictal make I feel sick light head and dizzy and nausea   and rash I stop take it I also take a low dose of seraqual it seem to be make I ill too and make it hard to want to anything its hard getting out of bed and fight fatigue I should be over side affect by now its be about   week and I be inbetween drs appointment it suck iv never have this much side affect maybe rash or nausea   I almost want to go to the er but trying wait it out hope the doc give I something else because I have a lot of anxiety on top of it
I totally relate to this sound like you be talk right out of my head I can not shake this horrible tired I be tired constantly before I stae the med n they stae I at   mg of limictal after the first   day on that dose I be gtg then they double that n I be on now   mgs and I hate this feeling I have have a headache seriously since I stae the medication I feel more anxious and far more down than before I be medicate from what I can tell from other people this be pa of your body adjust to it I be tell to keep try it but the goal be to get I up to mgs and I already want to die at just mgs ugh keep at it talk to your prescriber and try to remember that this be just a phase and that it will balance out at some point   sorry I be not more help n do not have answer but you be defiantly not alone in the way you be feel
can not say it enough talk to your dr   some med need other to work well or that med might be to strong but when we first get put on med to help our mind get what it need we do sometimes crash you probably have not sleep good in a long time so your body will make up for that once the mind be get the right amount of med it need we all go throw guilt you have to remind yourself you take a step to make your and your son and family life well you have take control
most people with this illness need medication to I it be a quality of life choice I take the minimum amount of medication to control my disease because the quality of my life be well with it than without it why choose misery over relative wellness I do not want to just survive I want to live
I try the no medication route and the anxiety become so bad that my hand and foot became freeze cold and mind my chest hu like I be have a hea attack no more of that I need to be medicate
I hate the pa of who be I   be this really I etc of med and bad side effect which be why I be get off gapentin and cymbalta I have be on gabapentin for   or so year for migraine and possible mood help that be a bitch to get off of cymbalta though pretty easy I have suicidal ideation generalize anxiety disorder panic disorder and psychotic depression w manic episode I do not have much suppo save for my mother and a few other people but I be currently train a currently will chowboxerhuskystaffie pit to be a service dogsmilingface hopefully I can be fully off my medsminus the bih control within the next   month the doggo be my service puppy in training spencersmilingface
I take med for my bipolar   disorder I do not think that they help I though I be still struggle a lot with my mood and with my depression live with bipolar disorder andor with depression make life so difficult
I be on a list of medication that would scare people at one point in time I be proud to say that I have be off all psych and epilepsy med for over four year there be day I feel like it be too much to handle but overall I be deal well off the med than I ever could have on they it be doable and it be woh it
I staed see a naturopathic doctor after my psych basically tell I I be out of med option I be not on any med but have change my diet drastically gluten and dairy free am take iron supplement will be add some homeopathic remedy soon as well as probiotic and protein shake to fix leaky gut and keep my stress as low as possible for now it have work amazingly I can definitely tell how my mood change and how much more susceptible to change emotion I be when I eat gluten or dairy now that I have go off it it might not work for everyone and some people can do it while stay on a very low dose of medication I might have to go back on low dose of lithium once stress increase but I figure it be ceainly woh a shot my dr try to treat my whole body I be also see an acupuncturist who do stuff with my head and give some chinese medicine advice for it I be currently do more and more research into chinese medicine and reflexology and natural medicine stuff it be amazing how deficiency and poor diet can affect your brain also I be test for neurotransmitter deficiency so I be wait to hear the result and then will take a naturapathic approach to correct they
I have trouble understand this no disrespect it be explain to I throu a medication drug trial if someone be diabetic and need to have insulin but do not want to cos it be medication you would be cross at they their body need the medication to help their body as it do not make the insulin the same go for depression just a different organ my brain do not make enough of the chemical it need to get I throu just like a diabetic do not make insulin to get they throu   I even try on med that be to low and I just could not keep my head above water but now I be settle on the med that be work for I I have no desire to go back to the horrid struggle do not get I wrong thing be not all peachy and good I still have struggle but I be much well at manage those time   the other thing I learn be people wait to look to get help people wait   year before speak to the doctor and they should be see someone after   week I have someone close I speak to say if you notice I be not good you need to tell I those close know something be not good and they be the one that need to say something so you can seek help
I deal with my anxiety by take my medsi also confront my anxiety but push myself to the limit
I have be deal with mine on my own even think of med make I anxious     
if it be high blood pressure and you change you diet and exercise and still suffer would not you then talk with your dr about a low dose medicine to help you feel well
I doit a struggle but focus on positivity and remove the trigger that set you off hope that help
try to find a doc who will do extensive blood work to make sure all hormone be balanced and everything else be balanced integrative family medicine doctor do this and prescribe bioidentical if need   then cut out gluten and anything else irritate to balance   read the book the mood cure especially if you do not want pharmaceutical
I be on medicine but I be horrible at take it but I do notice a huge difference when I be do good and I be on it   it make I feel soo much well
I be not   I have read too many horror story   seem like a case of the cure be bad than the disease
I do not medicate sure I take vitamin d to help but I stop or reduce my use in the summer some day I quite simply have to deal I have to cry my way through it pretend I feel happy put on false smile when I feel like I can not even breathe feeling like everyone would be well off without I I have to struggle through and if I do not have the paner that I have suppoe I it would be a lot hard
I have be off an on medication over the yrs it totally depend on my stress level at the time I never push my son into take med eitherit be definitely a personal choice my son ask to try med a year ago at the age of   and it be his decision and it have be helpfulhe even make the   honor roll for the first time even with a learning disability I have also manage a youth mental health group home for   the last   yrs and our client have a say in their medication management as well
I be be currently off all my med I will get back on they if I need to but I have be use vitamin and supplement and I also recently move to co where pot be legal and I have find a couple strain that help my anxiety   it be new to I but I hate med and yes I know that be pa of bipolar but I have other health issue and it be not sma for I to be on   different pill every day that do affect my liver and kidney very badly   I will say I always end up back in they when or if I have a bad manic episie but so far I be keep that under control by make myself eat and sleep   that seem to break up a manic cycle   take it if you need to but if you can manage without it I personally feel like that be a well way to go if you can handle it all
yes and no when first diagnose with depression sad   and adhd I be put on med for all three at the same time longggg story sho it be not until many month later that I realize the anxiety med do nothing for I and that the regular frequent and increase dosage be why my grade tank that spring although I have ask previously and be tell otherwise I find out that the benzo be give I memory loss and prevent I from retain new info I be in vet school at the time obviously such side effect create more anxiety for I   I spend the next year off and on each med try to figure out what the heck be happen deal with depression and panic attack along the way find a new doctor after conclude it be not get well without meds new doctor she think my anxiety and depression may actually stem from not control my adhd we have be   month in now for just adhd med without anxiety or depression med not quite perfect yet but well than where I be if I could afford more therapy session with the psychologist I think I would be much much well and if I could get out of my live situation the environment have trigger that would not be tolerable for healthy people at time
I be on lamictal and seraquel   year ago and they both incapacitate I to where I could not leave the house that last for a month then jump off all my med because that just be not no way to live my life be a great big struggle but I would rather live and screw up on a daily basis than be a walk zombie    so nine year off all of it no regret
  that be my big fear it affect my kid more in the long run
I have not be on medication for several year now I be not able to find one that really work for I I staed eat differently and exercise I staed make time in the sun just   minute a day a priority it be hard to do that in the winter here however I do what I can I do still have severe low I will not lie and say it be easy it be just work for I I hope that everyone be able to find something that work for they be that medicine or not so much love to all who be struggle
the last medication I be on I have very strong suicidal thought and I even self harm   so I have be scared to try anything else that be why I be not medicate
I have work for year on my ad this be what have help I for depression I take htp and walk when I walk I have my talk with god and give all my problem to he I also so a lot out walk I know who I can talk to when I be stae to feel depressed I do not try to hide it anymore for anxiety I deep breathe some people have a mantra they repeat to get past the anxiety I just talk to myself and remind myself I be ok I also avoid stimulant
I be too scared to take all those medsthe side affect scare I to death I would like to try the canibus but do not know where from where I live
you will know if you need medication   it be a matter of function or not function for I life or death however mental illness run in my family it be genetic for we I have not have the traumatic experience which because some people problem such as abuse or fighting in a war   I think the because of the mental illness have a great deal to do with the maintenance of the illness      I be not a professional I have have a mental illness since I can recall I be about   year old depression and be now   bipolar   and ocd life be a struggle sometimes but I can live a relatively normal life   it be a personal decision like take any other medicationfor instance if high cholesterol run in your family diet and exercise may not be enough to put your symptom and number in check in that situation after the other change have fail to make major alteration you may be prescribe medication by your doctor however it be your personal decision to take they or not good luck to you and blessing on your journey
I always feel like it be more of a hassle to go to the drs   and try to find the right med I be diagnose when I be   but I refuse to do anything about it I be   now and my current dr   I have only tell she about my anxiety and major depression most day I can be ok but other I do not get out of bed I have two young kid and it drive I insane that I do not have the energy or care to get up and do something I can manage to make sure there feed and clean but sometimes that be the good it get I do not work right now so it not like I have place to be   mental illnessaddiction run in my family I have lose   family member in the last   year to overdosingi have also have traumatic experience while I be a child   and now as a adult   I do not have a suppo system so it be hard   and I be scared to keep try do the right med I know it would make a difference if I actually tell my dr I be bipolar and be reevaluate now that I be old and its bad but I be to   scared I guess
I have try med before with no such luck I decide to try nutritional response test acupressure and find out I have ton of mercury and aluminum in my system which basically cause I to be in fight or flight mode all the time and make I have unbearable anxiety and depression change my diet and detox from the heavy metal and I feel so much well
I be perscribe med but I do not take they I struggle everyday to function my family n friend try to tell I I need they
I be currently unmediated as I be breastfeed I do have the option of take my medication with regular blood test for both bub and I but choose not to I struggle throughout my pregnancy but seem to be do ok now   month later I struggle with anxiety at time and have recently struggle with high mood I be just think today a I be look forward to go on my medication though
I need to be on med or I lose touch with reality get very paranoid and slip into a psychosis I have bipolar
  no medication never be on they I be able to handle my anxietydepression without medication I find music and work out my cope mechanism
yes I work full time for a general surgeon   work out be my escape   pulg   in my head phone and blast my music I be marry with two small child so yes I do suppo a family I may add my husband have a tbi and ptsd so I be the only one who work not much family suppo as I do not talk to anyone about it because of my husband own issue look I be sorry if I be able to handle anxiety and depression without medication not everyone need medicine what be with bash people who can self manage usually that be a good thing
I be not take med they make I so ill I give up on they   year of different type and they all floor I just struggle along now good I can
I be   diagnose at   every medication I have be on make I sleepy and make I feel like a zombie   I have   kid I can not be sleep all the time   I do not take medication and have not for about a year now   some day I struggle but for the most pa I have learn how to deal with my emotion and not be on the emotional roller coaster
my personal experience get ready to be a guinea pig it take decade n numerous doctor to find a combo of six different medication that keep I stable n it take week to see any affect but I suffer from three different diagnosis my point be yes it can get well I be way well on medication than without but its a long road of trial be open n honest with your doctor tell they everything even if its small or embarrass its the only way to get result
it all depend what be prescribe if you can handle what be go on stay natural but if it be thatn bad your life be getting interrupt I would worry about that and get fix more than sex
I get like you when my anxiety be at its high peak I have to go and be alone in my room after I disconnect from people and noise it just get too chaotic at time I can most likely return and try my good to keep as calm as I can anxiety be a monster their be many different med to help I just happen to be med sensitive to most peace to youvictoryhand
I think each and every person who post about their struggle and triumph while handle their respective mental illness be very brave respect be deserve for be able to be open about something so private kudo and pray for the day I can be so brave
I be so sick of closed minded people who have no idea what it be to suffer from mental issue nobody ask for this n if your not a person with a illness or a doctor you will never understand my hea have become harden to this world I suffer from bipolar depression anxiety and have border line personality disorder and a schitso affective I spell horribly sorry my point be I have become very blunt n honest I tell people this upfront cuz I do not care what you think of I I be I n can not change that if you can not deal with it there be the fn door n get out of my life do not be ashamed for who you be and remember you be not alone n although we do not know each other personally I be allway here to listen to someone who be struggle mentally good of luck
I feel like this be a version of the decision I have to make when someone ask how I be do do I give they the polite answer or the real one not always an easy decision to make nor be it ever comfoable and I also have be on the other end sometimes it be not helpful to I to be on social medium and sometimes it be not helpful to my health to hear about someone I care much about be struggle because I really do take all of that upon myself I be tell by a friend that my skill in be so sympathempathetic be a gift but often time it be more of a curse however I think the good thing you can do in this situation be to thank say family member for communicate that to you and offer they step they can take to avoid see such post it be possible to stay friend with someone and not see their post on the newsfeed this past election year for the us I learn real quick how to do that to extreme friend on all side      keep your cool and remember it could be as simple as they not get it or   maybe not be able to handle it and approach you about it even if it be in a rude way if it be really mess with your day wait to respond until you be feel a bit well I definitely know how this go you do not want to ruminate excessively on a response nor do you want to say something you will regret later or be anxious about it I assume as a family member you will have to interact with this person again regardless what be say on facebook again if the post you make be helpful to you I feel you should be able to continue they without regret but maybe in the response if you feel comfoable do it explain that to say family member how it be help you by post while acknowledge that it may not be helpful to himher and present fair option to help this person filter it on their end
my assistant pastor tell I that it be not a faith statement to post but for I it be very therapeutic I have find many onlinefriend turn out to be bipolar suffering depression which help to know folk know what you be go through it be kind of alarming when you realize the number too but I post anyway subscribe to page like this and on twitter also and note in a diary app I even create a totally private page with a pseudonym wherein I can post exactly whatever and keep it to myself not on it much but it be my page I can understand they be affect because it be pretty weighty I would suggest create a closed or private group and invite only those folk who be genuinely suppoive who want to understand love   prayer
keep on post this be about your journey and if they be so uncomfoable with the information avail for they to get educate and maybe have some empathy then let it be their problem not yoursthey do not have to read your post but you have the right to do what you be do good luck   god bless redhea
I always pretend to my family and friend because I know it upset they but if they do not like it they do not have to read it xx
sorry that should say affect a lot of people will balk at this but pa of deal effectively with your condition be build resilience and self will and confidence that be nice talk for you have to toughen up I know it be hard and it feel like go against yourself but to live well with your illness you will have to grow a thick skin because people be hostile to thing they do not understand and they be also very reluctant learner
I brag because there be day I can not I have be deal with this illness since I be   so it be be more than half my life I now keep a little welli call it my emergency backup kit with toothpaste shower wipe dry hair shampoo brush everything hygeine   the struggle go on but I can not let it destroy other health care
maybe if you know you be get anxious and depressed about itslow down and focus on just you and I do not mean masturbation either breathing exercisesmeditate read book cook food you love try to not be sexual it may help you figure out why you feel this way just an idea feel well

I dread the nightit the bad

it be a horrible horrible disease for the afflict and their love one I sit here one of the collateral damage but I know for my mom the afflict with manic depression it be a great hell she be in than mine
that be actually true I hv be struggle with bipolar disorder since year of medication have not help I n my own confident do not understand
guilt be such a huge struggle for many of   we   I carry it around every day and it be exhausting but it be so hard to let go of I can feel your pain just for read your post the fact   that you think about it make you a great mom we just have a hard time forgive ourselves at least I do
I be bipolar   which be diagnose major depressive episode hypomania talk way to fast we be fidgety can not sleep for long period at a time without feel sleepy kind of like be on a speed drug mania cause you to act irrationally like just pack up and leave everything behind when you finally become more rationale again youe like what the heck do I do our thought process be way out there in left field beleive g that what we say be the gospel we be difficult   to treat come up with the right drug combination be   difficult hope this help   those that do not understand the scale   
this be new to I but I understand it I be very bipolar and I make destructive decision and irrational choice what type do you think I be   be nice to see what you all think so when I get to dr I get medicine that help
I have a child the same and a paner with adhd I understand somewhat of what you go through it be soo stressful
sometimes the soul be big and bright and the only way to satisfy it be locate its counterpoint and not force something that you know you do not feel because you will be miserable
I do not know I get very shakey during and anxeity attack
yep they will never understand the struggle
I can not make simple phone call or answer they   that stop a lot of thing currently flow in my life to continue to flow with ease I rely to heavily on my paner to do simple thing I should be able to do   even like go to the doctor to get my anxiety deal with seem like it take month of coerce for myself etc
when I be overwhelmed I just pull away   the few channel and connection that need to be make be keep go as they be a necessity   other than that there might be some hard decision that you just have to make in your favor   we need some win   I hope my little rant be not bothersome   I have my own mental illness everyone have their own   this work for I   if it work for someone else great   if not sorry
yep same hear I have to get someone to come to the doctor and even then I often can not go I constantly cancel thing and avoid the phone door ect
I have trouble understand this no disrespect it be explain to I throu a medication drug trial if someone be diabetic and need to have insulin but do not want to cos it be medication you would be cross at they their body need the medication to help their body as it do not make the insulin the same go for depression just a different organ my brain do not make enough of the chemical it need to get I throu just like a diabetic do not make insulin to get they throu   I even try on med that be to low and I just could not keep my head above water but now I be settle on the med that be work for I I have no desire to go back to the horrid struggle do not get I wrong thing be not all peachy and good I still have struggle but I be much well at manage those time   the other thing I learn be people wait to look to get help people wait   year before speak to the doctor and they should be see someone after   week I have someone close I speak to say if you notice I be not good you need to tell I those close know something be not good and they be the one that need to say something so you can seek help
I be glad you make this statement I always wonder if med be good for I or not I think it depend on the severity of your illness some people be bear with it and really just have to learn to cope therapy and medication help those individual but my mother believe in try to better your state of mind naturally whether its wake up early amd stae a routine cleaning exercise as and craft change your lifestyle to where you be a little more productive can make a big positive change in your life when I be active I be happy when I be not I se to dwell on negitivity for I its jist a battle of stay active stay positive I tale med no therapy but I do lot of as and craft
I be on medication for year but it just make I very tired and gain weight   I have be off since may   I can get really anxious sometimes but I try to go for a walk or listen to music and it will usually pass   I be hope exercise will help too
why be so miserable when you do not have to be med really do help most people
I do say most people there be plenty out there that can not tolerate they I be sorry for your struggle this thing be a crazy ass beast
I have try numerous prescription   medication and be more miserable on they than off I do occasional use cannabis to relax I
I smoke cannabis oil and it will help be manic symptom down like rapid hea beat racing thought anxiety the urge to constantly be do something it really help prevent manic episode
yes sometimes the anxiety   can be too much for I I have find some good edible that give I the calm that I need I just can get they all the time
yep it can increase anxiety temporarily but the relaxation that come afterward be so comfoable
sometimes it be necessary there be no sense in struggle through life when there be thing out there that can help you live a more fulfilled life good luck my friend I be here if you need an understanding ear plus I will be graduate in may with a degree in psychology   ceification in crisis intervention
nicole I would love a life without med but my life be not what I want it to be without med I have come to accept that I will always be on med the depression would eat I alive I do not try to push just let people know my experience on the med I be on or have be on I have biplor ii the irritability and rage be too much for I to handle on my own good luck to you whichever road you choose   
I have be smoke marijuana most of my adult life and it help I well than any pill I have try everyone be different and some say it make they paranoid so cbd oil might be a well place to sta than just smoke the flower depend on how it may effect you
I have be on every man make med since I be   and I be now   I straight up tell my doctorsno more medical cannabis be my choice as it be natural and great to help I eat and sleep   and calm my horrible thought which be constant it be not for everyone but just think I would throw it out there     good luck   
  this have help I through a lot calm I down when I get in panic attack mode
stop take it personally and try to be her savior use your understanding to recognize that her symptom can not be relieve by you what work for you might likely not work for she she must find her way for herself your job be not yo fix she only suppo she be probably pull away from the pressure you be put on she not to isolate she be go to isolate like it or not its pa of the symptomology
I be scared to go back on my lithium   I rather drink in my house
I think avoid eye contact be a autism thing
it can also be anxiety a lot of people with anxiety will not be able to make eye contact I use to do it when mine be really bad always keep my eye on the floor or on thing around I for some reason it freak I out to look people in the eye
see your doc tell they its an emergency or call an out of hour one   you must be feel dreadful big hug
wth   I be tell to never manufacture excuse for how I act or how I feel   it be a disease not something to be victimize   the moon be full smack of lunacy   or crazy something we fight hard to overcome any stigma of   leave unsupervise   so we have to be care for like a child   come on admin you know this be not the message we want to put out there for people suffer depression bipolar or anxiety   I have be see too much of this like of posting on this site for my liking
but reread this post it be not really one of the bad one when you be strike with bipolardepressionanxiety it do make you feel pretty helpless
I have a horror story about that medicine a friend brother have a very tragic reaction to it
first of all if you can you need to go and fight this out at your pharmacy and have they correct the problem this have happen to I before but the pharmacy will be shake by you confront they about you go cold turkey off your med you can not and should not do thus it be very dangerous if it be there screw up they need to fix it but deal with they face to face   good luck
I feel this way all the time off and onthat be the horrible reality of bipolar disorder do you take you medicine as direct you should not run out before the next refill if that be the case you need to be really careful about thatif not talk to your doctor about adjust your prescription call they and tell they what have happen most of they be more than willing to help fill the gap with your med
I have ptsd but I be also a clinical therapist I would advise to see your doctor and ask for an anxiety medication in addition to the antidepressant antidepressant do not help for panic attack and if your out of the month supply already you might be try to self medicate with the wrong med take more than the prescribe antidepressant can give you side effect like suicidal thought I would even advocate you smoke a marijuana joint it have instant calm effect call your doctor
I use to be you do not worry you be not alone we be even the same age sometimes the thing that should make we happy get to be over whelm where do we go from here please work on make small reachable rewarding goal for yourself when you feel like self harm play with your child be goofy force yourself to live I have also stae cbd it have work wonder for I I have also make some other change as I suggest and I be slowly figure out that my life my journey all depend on I I have the power to control my thought they do not control I I hope you can find well outlet until your med can be fix stay strong and hang in there you be love more than you will ever know
I have bpd and bipolar   my bad day sneak up on I even though I be take my med as prescribe when I notice that I be go down I distract myself I keep my hand busy so I be not itch to harm myself I knit and to take my mind off thing I watch series or a movie if you have pet they be great for therapy marijuana do help alot with anxiety in this last year I have not be able to have much therapy because money have be super tight so I have to teach myself to cope please phone your doctor to adjust your med so you have enough for the month if you find you can not cope with what I have mention for distract yourself then definitely go to the er they will be able to sedate you to keep the edge off before you can get your prescription good of luck I hope thing come right
cbd oil help really well with anxiety and depression it be make from marijuana but without the thc that get you high it be over the counter in health store in florida pretty sure it be in all   state right now
you can find it on the iternet they have it in vape form and in candy form too I be still do my research on a company that sell online before I try I have a chronic disease as well as depression anxiety and bipolar
buy a b complex vitamin almost all woman havea b defiency which cause anxietyin which may help prevent that there be also a website that give you   percent off prescription that walgreen honor
I be against marijuana but when it be for medicinal purpose I be all for it my daughter use to get bad anxiety attack so I take she to get some marijuana the guy there explain what would help she the good it help she and I be grateful for it be sell I be not say to buy some because that would be your choice you should find out about your medicine god bless
I would talk to your dr about an adjustment if you be already out of your medication either you need a high dose or something else because while some anxiety med be as need antidepressant be take regularly at the same time same time every day to be effective either way please talk to your dr because you do not have to suffer
eat a apple a day also help with anxiety and depression
I be   my life be not together and I have depression and bad anxiety during an attack tell yourself to breathe through it and that your okay over and over again as far as self harm go look at yourself in the mirror tell yourself your beautiful and that you do not want to hu yourself over and over again until the feeling go away you get this I feel your pain I really do you can get through this and also let your husband know how you be feel so that he can watch you and help you through this
ahh   yes   so true   shame we have to hide sometimes

the other scar I view with contempt and shame and want they out of my sight
I have see some pretty awesome tattoo to cover cut scar my son cut for a sho period of time we be move from california to louisiana he be so upset about move that be when it stae I immediately take he to his psychiatrist he be   now he be   he have not cut since
when I be not medicate I usually get so mad that I would usually go and punch a steel locker to avoid punch other I leave multiple deep fist shape dent in the steel break my knuckle a few time one time my knuckle be swolen for a month its very dangerous for I to not be medicate one wrong word and i d kill someone
I too no fear just rage I just want to punch someone in the throat I get very aggressive
when ever I get into that rageirritation mode all I can feel be anger I do not feel anything but anger no fear or anything else I plan on stay on my med just hope I can get off the depakote I really really do not like the weight I have gain
I always say acceptance be the hard thing in life I would kill to be the old I whenever I have try get off med the bipolar come quick irritable and full of rage and then I spiral way down into the depression I just can not handle that please stay on your med I do not want you to die
as soon as I sta cry my eye burn so much I have to stop because the pain get so bad and the long I can go without my med be about   day after that the bipolar swing right on in and I have come to term that I will be on med most of my life as well I can not risk it I have almost die way too many time because of my mood swing
cry only make it bad but it be an outlet for the depression then I get a migraine damn if you do damn if you do not I totally understand not want to be on more med I do not like be on all that I be on but I have come to accept that I need they and probably will for the rest of my life I have try go off of a few and it be a disaster it be to the point where I should have be hospitalize but I just would not put that worry on my kid
yes   full neuropsych testing have I my iq strength weakness and an adhd inattentive type diagnosis   on low dose focalin   it wire up the anxiety though   chemical balance be so intriquite
I vape cbd oil it only help my anxiety a little bit
I need to ask my doctor for an adhd test because I have already be diagnose with bipolar   generalized anxiety ptsd and borderline personality I have so many of the symptom associate with adhd but I just do not know what to say or how to bring it up to my dr

I be never diagnose with adhd until around age   desperate I do a round of test like it sound you do I be complate go back to school but do not want to if it be just some else I be go to fail at my result be helpful the iq testing give I a number that tell I I be not too stupid to try this and when we find the right medicine let we just say I make an a in a course I have fail once and take an incomplete in the second time since you have already finish testing find out everything you can from they it reassure I and can help you in make plan for the future
the iq test scare I the most do not know my result of it yet but curious to know what affect it have on diagnosis with adhd be people iq with adhd high or low maybe he be test it to see if I have learn disability I suppose   I get what your saying though always want to go to college but I can not read or study to save my life
test for all that get another dr   be just honest and open with your symptom   all of they even the good one anxiety can be relate to paranoia which be a scale and not just think alien be after you or some shit

I have read vitamin d help with acne just take it as a supplement also try sleep with a white pillow case because some dye irritate the skin there be a lot of thing in a diet that can also affect the skin and hormone problem as well
I totally understand a few month ago I be in the same boat sometimes people can be super sensitive to topical acne treatment salcylic acid break I out worse and it be usually a first line treatment the only thing that have mostly work for I be a simple cleanser and moisturizer I use cerave product the gentle cream cleanser and the moisturizing lotion every morning and at night I do the same and use the cerave serum   which have retinol which be good from everything from fine line to acne be sure to wear sunscreen because it have a tendency to make you burn fast for whatever reason I know you will have an overwhelming amount of response but just remember sometimes it be well to sta from scratch also I stop drink caffeine and I believe that have help my skin immensely as well and my anxiety too
you have to determine your skin type oily combo whatever to really pick the right otc product or else they do not help also do not switch product constantly it irritate skin and expect it to get bad before when you do sta something new because your skin may freak at first like what be this goop lol if nothing worm see a dermatologist salicylic acid be make for acne
it take time so allow yourself to heal cry uncontrollably scream to the top of you lung feel sad feel broken but do not allow it to define you you be not unlovable this relationship be a pa of you but it be not you take this time to reflect on who you be who you want to become and reflect on what you want from a relationship if you get yourself in the right head space the next time around you will be able to bring   into the next relationship
I know exactly what you be go through my gffiance of   year leave I   week and   day ago   the heaache and the hu be so unbearable that I can not handle it or stand it   I think for sure I finally find the one that I could be with forever   she will and always be the love of my life I still love she and care about she and worry about    I miss she so much and love she so much that its kill I inside   we both have a mental illness   illnesse   it seem as the day go bye it get hard and hard to live without her

car thank you hun just struggle quite a bit at the moment same always hate if you need anything xxx
iv not read any comment just read this because it be not correct do not tell your self because you have bpd you think other that know you have this you be like this list they will think you aregreat worry
this post be not even accurate sign and symptom people with bpd may experience extreme mood swing and can display unceainty about who they be as a result their interest and value can change rapidly other symptom include frantic effos to avoid real or imagine abandonment a pattern of intense and unstable relationship with family friend and love one often swinge from extreme closeness and love idealization to extreme dislike or anger devaluation distoe and unstable selfimage or sense of self impulsive and often dangerous behavior such as spend spree unsafe sex substance abuse reckless driving and binge eat recur suicidal behavior or threat or selfharme behavior such as cut intense and highly changeable mood with each episode last from a few hour to a few day chronic feeling of emptiness inappropriate intense anger or problem control anger having stressrelate paranoid thought have severe dissociative symptom such as feel cut off from oneself observe oneself from outside the body or lose touch with reality

yes I know   just one of mine be over   if my insurance do not pay for it it be   horrible you know it only cost the drug company pennie on the dollar to make the drug
I have these symptom but have never be diagnose with bpd   I do take regular medication for anxiety though   should I be look to be diagnose and if so do I need medication
most if not all of these be symptom of other disorder or even thing that people with neurotypical brain experience you only need medication for something if it will improve your quality of life if you have concern that your current medicationdiagnosis do not cover talk to your doctor about they they can make a determination about another diagnosischange your medicationwhat have you otherwise do not worry yourself by assume you have a completely different disorder when you might not fit the criterion at all
all those be I to a tyet I be remain undiagnosed I have manic depression and high anxiety and insomnia
I highly relate to all of the above n its horrible its like your trap inside a bubble full of water and everyone around you be oblivious to it they can not help you because they do not no how to or they do not notice the difference in you

I be also bipolar plus ocd anxiety ptsd and depression I try all of the mood stabilizer and I would literally fall asleep at my desk at work abilify be great but weight gain be unbearable I be now on effexor mg remeron and trazodone   I just stae remeronweight gain again but I be to the point where I would rather have that than the alternative it truly have be a god send good luck hun
I totally understand I be rarely even out or middle of the road but now I have learn to sense it when it come over I more I still get way overwhelmed but too I try to get a handle on it I be on   med it take patience and lot of work to control some can never achieve peace I know I will never be at peaceprayer for you
I be bipolar   with mixed episode   and I totally understand   it be very difficult to explain   everyone think it be one or the other   your either hi or low   but that be just not the case   I do not know if I could actually say anything that would help   honestly   just know that your not alone   there be lot of we out there and do the good you can everyday not for anyone else but for yourself I personally feel accomplish when I make it through those horrible episode   because I make it through and you will too do not give up   it take I a few doctor and a few decade to find the right med for I but I finally have now so again do not ever give up   you will figure out what work well for you just keep be honest about evehe to your doctor that be what be work for I
yes its an uncomfoable feeling and I feel intense confusion
a stable life sleep pattern all help stay away from stress   stressful people too much be sometimes not good there be load of side effect check urs change if necessary every case person different but just general advice
I be sorry that be horrible
what you be experience be call a mixed state I experience they too although I have get type   bipolar it can be really tough but I have experience episode of it where I function well consider everything that be happen in my head other time I really struggle it be really difficult to explain unfounately
yes definitely how I feel about it it be a daily struggle and a nightmare
yep I struggle with this every day I try
those who laugh do not truly understand what a real struggle this be
omg I be fight tear right now it be be a stressful emotional week for I
wowthat be I    and it make I upset to be like this no happy medium     
so the thing about that be that intentional motional reaction can have a physical side effect it be no joke that we tend to store our pain our suffering   or even our stress into our body   it may be side effect but it be always a good idea to talk to your doctor
I get sho of breath and hea palpitation   I see the doctor but it be anxiety
that be so true my daughter go through this and it be very hard to watch and understand but if people would take the time and learn about how to help and handle the struggle of the people who have to struggle with this illness you be correct if it be cancer or something you could see then it be acceptable so unfair for everyone
hi there   it sound as though you have be through a lot   post natal depression can be awful but of course depression can re occur later   good question will you always be on they I would rather look at it in this way rather than getting catch up with fixating on the medication as a bad thing I believe if it be help if be make you feel well if it be the crutch that be help you live your life enjoy your child if be it allow you to cope then surely it be get to be woh it and it be make the difference between your life work and not work I get so catch up at one stage when I have rebuild my life and recover in the idea that I have to come off they   I think I be cope well and know I be not depress   I even go to the doctor and try to discuss the idea of come off they I have convince myself lead up to the appointment that this be the good step but deep down I have a nagging doubt that if I encounter anything paicularly difficult whether I would be able to cope luckily my doctor be great we discuss it fully and she help I to see that be on the medication be not a sign of weakness it be nothing to feel guilty or ashamed of and come off they too quickly might not be the good plan   I guess I know that deep down I have just got so catch up with the idea that to be fully well I need to come off the medication I think especially if you have a lot of stress in your life it might not be the good time to come off discuss it with the professional talk to your love one but do not feel you have to rush into anything well wish x
yes I have be on both   I do not have any med s I cut myself down slowly and never bother again   I do get odd bad day and still feel anxiety at time but I try and stay away from stressful people and situation    just keep happy people around and situation I also staed go to church god help a lot too xx
I give up on the citalapram   it give I that restless leg syndrome I have to take it at night just before bed otherwise it make I feel quite ill good thing I ever find for the anxietyhypervigilance phase I get ptsd too be betablocker   they be fkce great save my life a thousand time
once you find the right med it usually take at least two or three together then you will have a big step forward med can not take away personal issue in your life but it will allow you to handle tense situation a lot well
I have try to go off med   gradually several time but it do not go well I be currently take   different med for my depressionanxietyi have accept the fact that I will always be on med
I be talk about cannabis sativa or indica strain or hybrid can really help people
wish my dumb parent would get this thru there head so thru would understand how badly I be struggle
yes yes yes I be so glad someone say exsactlly how I feel   people act like I can just snap out of my depression it do not work like that   I have be struggle for year with out med   and right now I be not in therapy and I really need it and I be so alone and hopeless and my depression be suffocate I I just want to die my thought be so suicidal and dark and morbid and very negative   I can not control it there so intense   I do not ask to have depression can anxiety but I do but people make I feel like it be my fault dns I be a bad person which lower my already low self esteem
epilim be excellent   the old mood stabiliser be lithium which be hard on the kidney you do not have to worry about that with epilim you can still experience high and low but they be not as extreme if you have trouble with grandiose manias seroquel be good if you have trouble with depression there be a lot of choice do not stop take your medicine ever
remember thing get well we all have similar experience try do a little more each day thing that   you like try see positive each day stay away from stress pray to god x
I feel like you really need to tell your psychiatrist this because they can change up your medicine to help you especially ask for something for anxiety I do not know how well it would work on you but xanax have help the good for I I have not have an anxiety attack or mental break down since take it
first I can not tell you what to do or how to do it all I can   do be tell you my experience with this I be bear with brain damage cause by the doctor which leave I in a state of really bad disorder so you could say I lead what do from the day I be bear not know why I be so different from the other kid until I stae ask question I learn about my disorder but when it really get bad this after my ex leave and take the kid to pas unknown   I have have two nervous breakdown and the first one be really bad I try three time to kill myself twice with a shotgun and once with pill it be week later my doctor find out about the pill band a map I take along with alcohol I should have die that day but I get the bad case of diarrhea I have to sit on the toilet all day and half the night I realize I could not kill myself but I do not know I be go to die not once but twice in one evening month later I have get bit by a rattlesnake halfway point between where I live to where the hospital where I get the antivenom because the hospital here only have two vial   halfway to the other hospital I have die twice first time I die the emt bring I back but then I die again the second time I wake up and see emt come at I what the paddle to shock I back to life which he almost shock himself when I ask he what he be do then I realize my chest be hue I he have be pound on my chest to get my hea staed back up again he have tell I but during the time I be dead I think I would just dream I still feel the pain and hus not the physical hus but the mental hus that be what I learn it do not matter you still feel the mental hus even after death keep in mind I still think about suicide but then I sta to think about I be still in pain even after death   the good thing as find something you like to do and do it as long as it be legal fill your day with activity so you do not have time to think even if it mean do it by yourself just do not stay and one spot and do nothing this be not go to stop it from happen but it will lessen the pain because if you be too busy do something that can be enjoyable then you will not have time to think about the other thing the key be to stay active and do it when you do not feel like do it also keep in mind do not push too hard a little bit at a time will build you up then to try to do it all at once last time can be do with anxiety and panic attack do not ever brush it or try to do it like other do it do it at your own pace so get active and stay active also keep in mind no one can make you do anything but nothing can be accomplish by do nothing talk to who you can even if it be only on the internet I hope and pray this can help you but it be up to you to want to do it
I feel for you I can talk this way whenever you need please do not hesitate ok
it sound like you may be lonely too try reach out to someone to do something with work with your therapist to figure out why you be depressed and have anxiety you may want to go back to the hospital to get your med change up if you be feel suicidal I have be through all of the above it be constant work sometimes to feel good if I relax to long I back slide one of the big thing for I be be happy with my self I be I and that be ok I have chronic mental heath issue I have chronic physical issue I be shy my husband of   year dump I for a new model but I be learn that I be much more than these thing I have my good day and bad day I will forever be a work in progress I hope you be feel well keep we up to date on how you be do
do not give up keeping test the right med combo for you keep work we have to work hard to identify our trigger and we learn a new one daily also I want to add a warningif your bipolar and your doctor advise anti depressant rather then anti anxiety find a new doc people anti depressant for most bipolar soul only increase depression and intensify anxiety the good doctor know this and keep up with the ever change discover in the brain that be the one you want to keep note disclaimer although it be my experience and the experience of many of the people I have meet to have have adverse effect with anti depressant mostly paxil and prozac they may be beneficial for some listen to your doc find your zen when the dark creep in music a writing color read a book play with you pet anything that you can put your hand on and zen out on
I will be honest with you until you tell the world and everyone in it to kiss your   life will not change you will always feel insecure anxious silent afraid scared nonbelievable stuck I have be there it take I die to live

exactly the woman I love struggle with this I believe and do not believe I can handle it plus she be surround with manipulative shrew who lie for their own personal gain and she be too naive to see this truth
I do not suffer from bipolar but I suffer from anxiety which be a daily struggle which sometimes be not pretty x
yell be a pa of verbal abuse and yes it most ceainly will effect her confidence and self esteemseven be a bit young yet to explain disorder but if one day you be to have a motherdaughter moment say brush her hair you could approach the subject and maybe also try to assure she that you will also try to think thing through before you yellmy son have the same problem with mei be softspoken but when I get scared because I tell he not to do something and he do it anyway boy that make I madbut I want he to be confident to speak up so I promise I would try not to blow up but he have to do what I ask he to do
mummys hundred acre wood you be personality take on different character tigger be manic piglet be anxiety poo be foggy   owl be wise rabbit be high organisation bipolar and I have bout of this roo be the curious pa of you   etc give she something to relate to hubby n I have   kid this have work from   up
I think she be to young to know maybe in simple term say mummy get tired if you try organise thing well or relax more have some time to urself each day get a good sleep go for a msssage maybe then this will help you to be calm I be still struggle with most of these try see the difference between impoant thing to be upset about and the not so impoant sometimes get upset over small issue be not woh it give she   min to do something if she want even if it be bedtime my daughter same age spend quality time together obviously you know irritability be pa of the illness just control what you can breathe   I be sure most of you be have this issue we cope with a lot esp with kid just make a few change to help genetic be pa of it but so be living environment make everything as nice as you can get she into good habit like tidying sleep early this will help for future occasionally shout not gona affect so much but be aware do what you can to reduce it x
I have have the conversation with my daughter with increase detail as she have grow mommy have a brain that do not think or work like other I take medicine to help I but I still will sometimes be overwhelm this be the because for my frustration and why I feel the need to yell it be to right to yell at you and I be very sorry   I love you more than anyone on this eah and I be try my good to be a well mother to you that be why I keep try and sometimes it do not work it be not your fault and it be not right but I love you so much that I be do everything I can to get help   people be not perfect and parent be people too   do you have any question or what to tell I how you feel that be more or less how it goesand at least have the information and the fact could help she I grow up not know why with my mother so I be try to give she something she can be ceain about
I worry about that too with my   and half year old everyday I know she be not old enough but family therapy be not a bad idea when she get old the more she will understand but before I go off yell I ask myself be what she do age appropriate such as climb on thing I have tell she not to explore though mommys purse ect then I verbally identify my feeling and where they be come from   I be frustrate because I feel like I be not be hear it help I alot and give I a moment to cool off and come back to reality that she be a toddler before cause damage of yell
there be website to help you find way to talk to your kid when my daughter be   and my son be   I say down and explain the same thing to they child within this age range be very inquisitive and perceptive they understand a lot more now as their way of thinking be more logical and reflective you should sta off by talk about mental illness in general explain that just like a person can get physically sick their mind can get sick too you can then explain what bpd be and how it affect you for example you could explain borderline personality disorder be a mental illness that make the pas of your mind responsible for emotion sick it stop you from be able to control your emotion which be why I be sometimes very angry sad frustrated or annoy over little thing that people normally feel just a tiny bit angry sad frustrated or annoy over how I feel be no one fault and I will get well so do not worry your child may feel the need to help you feel well let they know it be not their responsibility and that there be special doctor who will help you recover from this illness but you could also suggest a drawing from your child will make you feel good so they do not feel so helpless
I have a ten year oldi have to tell she straight outi have bipolar ptsd and ocdi be also abuse by an ex so every so often I have these nervous tick and twitch she keep ask what be wrong with medo not know if its right or not tell but I do not know what else to do
you need to take care of yourself first with med I know you do not mean it but it can be abusive and very confusing to a kid talk to she about the illness and get help my mom be bipolar which ruin my childhood and it still hus   year after her death I will never forgive she for not take the help when she be diagnose
it be well to be honest I thinksome type of person to guide you be a good idea I think   be a fine age as long as you speak   year oldthere be many uncomfoable thing I have to explain to my kidsand not just about my mental illness I be sure you have have to also I be a bit nervous when mental illness be the subjectbut realize it just like explain other stuff be prepare for ton of question or none at allya never knowi also find that even with a professional guiding I it be well that I do most of the talking only because if there be more question   they would not feel worried to ask I because the pro be not aroundthat be just I though it will be ok  
sorry also you do not have to go into the specific or scary pas basic point of impoance surround treatmentlikelette she know you have a nice drhelping
I be bipolar   have anxiety and bpd mum of    of which be step kid   my own mental health be trigger through trauma as a child I be abuse physically mentally and sexually good thing to do be take your med get a mood diary go to all appointment maybe get you psychiatrist to refer you in to class which be absolutely fab I have do anxiety and cope skill ans have help I so much if you ever need a chat feel free to pm I always be honest with you child though I have always speak openly about my mental health to my baby so when my bad day come they understand its I and not they also family suppo make it easy too xx
I speak to my stepson when young be   and again this year young age   I do not fully explain it but I tell they sometimes I have trouble with my emotion and get really sad and cry a lot or angry and yell when you do not deserve it and I do not mean to do it and anytime that I do yell and they do not deserve it once I have calm down I talk to they and apologize for my action this have stop they from get as upset when I get like that I be rapid cycling bipolar no med when I be sad they try to comfo I without be overbear and if I be really tired they will behave and let I nap on the couch light sleeper while they quietly play or watch a movie and they wake I if movie end they be hungry or thirsty they be amazing at understand how I be but I have also be in their life from m and m respectively
single mother of an   yr old boy I deal with multiple mental health disability manic depressive disorder multiple anxiety disorder ptsd etcmy son have pick up my anxiety and he be in therapy just like mommy be he be also old enough for I to talk to he and explain that I be sick and it be not his fault and never will be and that I do not want he to grow and have the issue that mommy have when he be old   they may be child but they understand when it be from the hea hang in there         
I agree with all the therapy response   but my personal opinion be I think   be still a bit young to try an explain a mental health condition   before I snap on my kid I need remind myself to think through what be I be about to yell about   do it warrant raise my voice   what word to choose and how to convey they   definitely consult a physician but I worry that my kid my blow off a scolding by chalk it up to depression and not take I seriously when they really be in trouble
I disagree   be not to young my kid be amazing    and they have always understand I have mental disorder in fact they be always there always understand and have be the only one in my life who be they do not take it personally when I be irritable and yes I do try not to let that affect they
I have the same problem here I have anxiety and depression and I think I look for reason to yell to help I cope well which be totally not fair to my   kid my kid be good I just get easily frustrate cuz my hubby can tone they out and I hear every little noise they make they argue with each other and they all think they be the boss of each other tattling every   minute it seem like I never get a moment to think I just want to scream so I do for silly thing mostly I have not go to a dr in a while cuz I do not want there criticism I guess I be more ashamed of myself and when I talk about it it really hit home base and than the depression kick in than I be a mess it be not a fun disorder and many do not understand
my daughter be   we talk about feeling we talk about mommy get grumpy and snapping and how sometimes emotion be too big even for grow up I may go off in the moment but its how you handle the aftermath that be impoant address it when you have an angry moment I explain fully why I yell sometimes I be scared for their safety and yell to stop they from get hu sometimes I get so frustrated I laugh I explain that emotion be difficult and that my behavior be not ok but we have to keep work on it and talk together all of that with my   year old she get it when explain on her level bipolar and anxiety disorder here by the way find a simple way to explain that sometimes you can not help your mood but you be work on it tell she to help if need by maybe hug you if she think you need it maybe an outside warning flag before you get too upset it might help the big pa be explain that she be not the reason you be that way everyone be make differently and your brain be just a little different and that be ok   
also you occasionally yell at she be not go to cause she to have a mental illness she be at risk due to genetic also extreme traumaabuse can cause mental illness so assume you be not beat she or molest she you be not go to cause she to suffer the same disease she be at risk due to genetic but because you be knowledgeable you will know to look for the warning sign and know to get her help should she need it my parent be pretty perfect I have always be unconditionally love and suppoe and I still end up with bipolar and anxiety so do not freak out about screw your kid up a ton of therapist specialize in kid and can help she understand
yes if its often enough the child we feel fear and distress then it absolutely be traumatize she but there be solution and way to repair thing
I have a   yr old and she kind of do the same thing and I hate to say it but I can scream at she and scare she but one day I sit she down and explain to she that mommy do not mean to scream at she like that my brain be mess up and I have to take medicine to help I be happy she kind of understand I think just kind of put it into word she will understand
see my kid know when I be be serious and when I be just be an irritable ass
I think she be worried about the bpd as it be develop through truamtic childhood speak with your child there be no too young
I stress about stress before there be even stress to stress about then I stress about stress over stress that do not need to be stress about it be stressful and that be how every day be for I   I hate mental illness
this be how I feel and wish I do not have to go through this I feel ashamed to be depress sometimes
this be very true I also keep a lot of shit to myself because the one that actually do give a fuck be far too precious to I to risk alienate they with my shit I live they so much I think they deserve well than my shit so we concentrate on something else and their awesomeness make I forget about my shit
yes I talk to one person about everything and then I feel guilty like why be I talk about myself I should not have say anything no one care they think I be stupid and then I just want to curl up and cry as my hea sta to sink xo
story of my life I be do tell people about my pain hu   sadness despair   and sorrow I feel inside nobody understand or take I seriously   I always say suicide be my only option and I mean it   feel so lonely and lose broken and alone   nothing to live for   feel like a wohless failure feel totally hopeless     can not deal with my intense depression and anxiety   feel like I be in a nightmare    I know nobody care so I keep so much inside and   I hate it   need to let it out tired of hold it in can not pretend to be happy   can not be strong anymore ready to give up
it be the state you get yourself into that make you want to do it then it be the feeling that you become addicted to this be why the temptation be always there   I recently tell my psych that if they could create a pill that give you the same feeling as when I have self harm cut I would be fix of course that be not true but it just prove what a desperate state you find yourself in to want to harm yourself in order to feel well I have resist the temptation   not harm myself for   month now   whenever I feel that temptation creep in I call my good friend who know how to talk I down
see this be exactly what I would love to be able to do but my husband hate tattoos   I do go ahead   get one by my brother on my footanklejust above ankle area once though without say anything there be so many great idea I have think of but I doubt I will ever be able to do it as they be grand idea

oh my your pain come through it be awful to hear the struggle you be experience   it be clearly a half life you be live well not really live but merely exist if nothing now bring you pleasure   unfounately it sound very familiar but it might not be any comfo to you that the feeling you be experience will resonate with so many people when you be go though such turmoil each day can be a nightmare   day after day it be exhaust debilitate and so dreadfully unbearable   no wonder you have have these thought that you can not go on you do not want to be here and just can not see anything ever improve it be a viscous cycle of ruminate feeling alone abandon desperate constantly miserable and not be able to see an end to it all when you need the strength drive and determination to beat this hideous illness those be the thing which you often do not have please please do not give up hope   your family need you and want you   you express that your friend do not understand but you have not really totally open up to your family be this not something you could do to try to explain how bad thing really be it be very often the case we push our family away for many reason but can they truly help and suppo if they do not really know re the diagnosis medical appointment and medication   the recent diagnosis be only the beginning with regard to those issue be there no ongoing suppo from those I be no expe but diagnosis in itself be surely of little help if there be nothing provide on the back of that forgive I as I assume you might be in the us and I be in the uk and clearly service be very different but diagnosis alone could make thing bad in the sho term without the follow up suppo as it might just leave you with so many unanswered question again re the medical app and medication this all can be instrumental in provide a stable platform to build recovery   if the med be not right then it can be so much more difficult   I often view medication as a necessary in many case crutch to provide the stability to move forward   you explain these appointment be expensive but what be the potential cost to you your family and your daughter if they be not work once the medication be right the appointment then can hopefully lessen I really understand your pain having suffer previously for so long but I also know unfounately the pain and carnage a suicide leave behind   when you be in the middle of the quagmire of severe depression we do not always rationally view everything   so much can get obscure and we can make some terrible decision my psychiatrist warn I against make any big decision while I be suffer as we view the world very differently   I put no more thought into buy a house than a loaf of bread nothing have any meaning   it be so hard to see the wood for the tree apology for my english metaphor   I have see both side I guess   I know all too well the effect a suicide have on those close love one for a lifetime your parent and your daughter of course do not want to have to live with that   I be sure they all love you very much and would want to do all they could to help if they really could understand your pain I be so sorry to run on and I also know it be far from easy but in sho in the grand scheme of thing I guess the cost of the appointment and the potential happy life you could have be woh the money there be a real chance of have a well future a chance to be happy post depression for I be the sta of my new life   my depression well the last big one be my previous life small achievable step be possible but you need suppo and love care compassion   be kind to yourself you deserve to beat this you all deserve a well life   good wish thinking of you x
you be not alone try stay strong be there heap of time   it be a bloody horrible feeling you have a very good reason   live you be daughter because every child need their mum   thanx   my daughter I have stop cut   overdose   so plz   you be daughter sake hold on stay strong
do not worry you be not the only one go through this all my family do be be I down and husband be bad on friday after sleep for a week I try to see how I can hang myself but I say to myself I be well than this I have to be strong and bring myself up and if you need a friend you have one here anytime   
you need to relax try rest have a massage if it continue see a doctor well that than it get bad   say you have trouble sleep and relax quetiapine be v gd even in a small dose to be able to rest I tuk this after childbih ask bout this what med be you on do not worry sometimes it feel as if it be too much and when you can not sleep you think it be gona go into a relapse this happen many time to I it do not stop worry try rest   put bad thought to one side
all I could say be I feel your pain I be bipolar and general anxiety disorder and depression iv suffer a lot lately my doctor just switch too I be not use to my new doctor yet and he take I off my old med ativan and oxycarbozapine I know ativan be addict but it work my anxiety be to bad with out it I be now take seraqual for sleep it make I sleep nbut with side affect light head dizzy and nause and clonzapin for anxiety do not help to well hopefully he get to no I and know I do not abuse med just take as need and he will put I back on my old med so I can feel well take care and hang in there
although it be difficult for you with all the life stressor all at once you have to believe that everything change   it will pass as it have before stay strong hope a little peace come your way soon xx
pray for and all of we it be scary especially when you be not on med because of financial reason or they do not believe you
the good thing be you have survive through the darkness before now you be even strong enough to get through this too I understand how hard it can be to be overwhelmed with too much emotion hold on tight and do not let it win over you
sometimes I get so tired it can be a daily struggle I have good day I never seem to be at my full potential
my mother be I have a cousin who be as well I be diagnose with mdd major depressive disorder and anxiety but always wonder myself but also can not stand label be who I be try not to let it define I as a person I would say my depression have severely get bad since my grandfather die in   not only be he a grandfather he be like a dad I never have and a good friend all in one to this day I still have hard time get through it and go on without he he be one of the very few relative I be close to and seem to genuinely care about I
yes   my father have manic depression in the s diagnosis and treatment be little he have no treatment and unfounately turn to alcohol he go out and rob a bank in a manic state get   year he commit suicide when I be   my mother have anxiety and depression trace back to my family there be quite a few case aswell I be diagnose   year ago and after a few hospital stay I gratefully get the treatment I need my daughter have inherit bipolar and be also under good care and treatment my phyciatrist be convince it run in family
naturenuure I can not get a straight answer there be a gene associate with bipolar bp I know so I assume bp too if you have this gene its easily trigger some people without this gene can be throw into mh issue if truama be severe enough I worry about my girl but   I know to watch for sign so I can catch it early   get they into treatment I m always aware they be watch I   it help I stick to my treatment plan I want they to see I be responsable about it so if they ever have to they will know how
I do not know about bipolar   but bipolar   be genetic and be usually bring out by either trauma or by your early s it be possible to pass it down if you be a carrier that be why I be scared of have a second child it suck
my son have the genetic component but trauma   both physically as a baby from be very sick and mentallyreally show up after horrible bullying increase and intensify   his doctor neurologist genetic and physciatrist have tell we he likely would have have some so of anxietydepression but the trauma bring it on young and more intense definitely can be a combination of the two
yes it be genetic but can also be trigger I also have trauma and be mis diagnose with normal depression you do not have to have trauma to have it but that can trigger your bipolar it do not mean it will be pass down to your child it can skip generation I be worried about my kid but worry be just pa of we anyway I be open and honest to my kid about it so they understand it a bit more too hope this help x
first off I want to admit I be not a doctor and I be ignorantok why can not it be both people having have trauma have baby and raise they will not be perfect or any person for that matter would not their child be more susceptible genetically through trauma to be diagnose do not make it more complicated than it need to be they areyou be hu and need helpend of the story the question be irrelevantjust more anxiety
this be true my son have the genetic component but trauma   both physically as a baby from be very sick and mentallyreally show up after horrible bullying increase and intensify   his doctor have tell we he likely would have have some so of anxietydepression but the trauma bring it on young and more intense definitely can be a combination   
I be   year old and both my child have high functioning depression I have thieen sibling we suspect at least two have bi polar or depression we have lose contact with they my   year old neice have depression and anxiety
I believe it can be genetic it also can have nothing to do with gene gene only make pa of your brain and generally how it work some of it be highly affect by the outer world and circumstance I know my father be likely bipolar and have a lot of the other diagnosis I have my mother have chronic situational depression it be easily trigger and close to be clinical she just do not talk about shit so I think if she do it would be consider clinical my brother have severe anxiety and ocd and depression can be easily trigger for he I know later down our family line we likely have far more mental illness that be not mention at all but I know because I lean so strongly towards my bipolar gene that I show symptom around   and get diagnose officially at   which be practically unheard of especially   year back but it be obvious what the sign be most child under   be not ever diagnose I be diagnose at   with depression and put on useless for I and low dose antidepressant at nine I be show symptom but easily lie about it and cover it up I have be do ever since it be become a habit and people ask I why I do it and it be like I do not remember how not to so it honestly depend sometimes we be just deal crap hand sometimes it be pass down but it be always hell and it make we strong than anyone can ever understand
bipolar be not traumatic disorder but truama can be a risk factor
there be some genetic component but I have watch documentary and read book where they explain that people with the genetic can be non bipolar the gene can lie dormant in you and trauma or stress can trigger it
also I would research that   thing that sound like a random bs number it be a crap shoot if your kid get it and I have always be tell you be at a high risk of get it if it run in your family so I would say that be prob high than   I may very much be wrong but I do not think they really know
I stop my med as soon as I find out I be pregnant but be contiously advise by psychiatrist and consultant to go back on miazapine I manage to stay off they until I be   week but I have to go back on they staed at mg and build up to mg I really think I would have be in a really bad way post natal if I have not stae back on they I be assure first trimester be the risky for med xx
I be on bupropion seroquel hydroxyzine and lamotrigene while I be pregnant doctor want to taper and take I off of the seroquel because there be a risk of my daughter go into withdrawal I be unable to decrease let alone discontinue it but when she be bear she have no side effect whatsoever I know there be risk take any medication during pregnancy but the benefit vastly outweigh the negative my daughter be fine and my postpaum under control but whatever you feel be right for you and your baby be what you should do
hello I be almost   month pregnant and I remain on wellbrutin mg I use to be on lithium and wellbrutin   mg I go to a high risk dr who specialize in these case   see my therapist and my psych dr   I have have some bad low spot but I be very lucky that I be aware of it and I speak up right away and head straight to therapy   I be also very lucky I have a great suppo system   I be nervous about when the baby come out because I want to breastfeed and I be not sure I can   but my mental health come first
admit to myself that I have a problem in my rd trimester of my second pregnancy and my doctor prescribe zoloft I have much well day no problem withdrawl or defect with my little one breastfeeding be not a problem either I be not diagnose as bipolar   until a few month ago so I do not know how other med may affect pregnancy your doctor will weigh the risk and benifit hope this help redhea
hi and congratulation   my daughter be now   so I do not remember what I be on but whatever they be all the doc all agree they be safe during pregnancy but not safe enough for breastfeed   that be sad for I but there be so much more to that little life you will soon forget that pa my daughter be bear extremely healthy but because of genetic just because keep an eyeear out for any sign of dpression anxiety bipolar I be sorry I forget what you say you have and ifwhen you notice anything get heshe help as soon as possible    I have my daughter in to a therapist at age    like I say   now and still see someone and just this past week staed celexa for anxiety and depression    I be so so so sorry for the long message   good luck
if you be bipolar antidepressant will send you into a suicidal state of mind just be aware of that also research have prove that there be a high probability that ssris and antipsychotic med will effect your baby it be a risk
zoloftseraline be one of the safe med to be on during pregnancy I go back on it toward the end of my second pregnancy because my anxiety be get bad again I be also very concerned about my baby have withdrawal etc I seem to remember my dr tell I anything under mg be negligible and the baby she have see go through withdrawal after bih cry more for a day or two and then be fine   breastfeeding be not an issue for I on the seraline off name for zoloft I also breastfeed on psych med with my first cipralex and everything be fine too again zoloft be one of the safe med for pregnancybreastfeede   something I want you to know before this baby come your cup need to be full in order to pour into other your babys life I have go way too long try to fill my family up from an empty cup and it do not work your health need to come as a priority so that you can be as happy and healthy a mama as you can be   good luck hun   
my doctor tell I they would not put I on med when I be pregnant because the child could have withdrawl doc only give I visterail to help my anxiety it do not work just hang in there
offer hug if you be do okay on your med before you become pregnant I do not think you should worry too much about change they until a few month after the baby come let we not forget that with pregnancy come massive shift in your body hormone that could easily account for the increase in bad day after your hormonal level have return to a somewhat normal rate then would be a good time to reassess your medication   
I do not I have a miserable pregnancy and after get nasty postpaum depression which my family take advantage of   and my aunt now have adopt my daughter cuz that be what they convince I to do moral of the storyif you can find a medication that work for you and be safe for the baby take it
if you be bipolar the zoloft will not help it will only hu and I would suggest see a psychiatrist especially be pregnant medication be dangerous I understand treatment be crucial as I be bipolar   with mixed feature and severe anxiety I have to quit my treatment while pregnant and it be awful I wish you the good of luck mama no matter the direction you have to turn and congratulation
I be bipolar   and have a   week old baby when I fall pregnant I go to see my dr to talk about my med we have a really good chat and speak about the risk I already have   child that need I so I decide to continue to take my med god for mth my mood be really not good I nearly get take into hospital now   week on I be so glad I stay on my medmy little girl be fine there be not any problem with she at all I be on mg quetiapine and mg seraline noone can make your mind up but you they be risk with all med good luck and good wish xx
in the uk they like to put you on seraline for depression when you find out you be pregnant as it have the least possible risk for baby during pregnancy and breastfeedingi be move to it last year as my husband and I want to sta try for a baby by the time I fall pregnant this spring I be on mg per day decide to move down to mg as I feel well enough to do so but have the option to go back up if I really need to x
rest esp after childbih v imp a good care plan I have epidural to reduce stress   pain and risk of relapse think that help a lot   you need help with baby after delivery hospital should keep you in long than normal and ask nurse to help at night or you be midwife can maybe medication be v imp after bih I tuk lithium and quetiapine to help relax that help a lot sleep v imp but maybe you be diagnosis be different may need different med but this help I stay well ask someone to help with night feed after and do not take on too much get help if you notice any symptom
zoloft make I have suicidal thought and action my doctor stop it right away and I feel well almost immediately maybe talk to your doctor about stop it from what I have hear from some psychiatrist most individual with bipolar disorder should not be put on antidepressant because they could make mania bad or trigger low of low but hey I be not a doctor that be just what I have hear from doctor whilst in treatment center also I do not know exactly what your bipolar disorder experience be like it be different for all of we right now you have two people to think about your unborn child which god bless he or her need to be take care of before and after bih and then there be you the primary pa of the puzzle I say the primary pa because without you be in right mind mentally it will affect you physically which in turn will god forbid affect that beautiful child as I write this I be try to hold back tear because although I be not a mother I one day want to be one and what you be now go through I fear I will with my countless amount of medication and question each day if I will be mentally stable enough or if my baby will be affect if I take med but what you need to have right now and what I will need to have in the future be faith yes talk to your doctor about possibly get off the zoloft because maybe it be cause those bad thought and do the technical psychiatric pa of the process but like they say there be science and then there be god I encourage you if you be a pray woman to pray on it especially when you get those thought he will listen do it for you do it for that bless child all will be alright I promise you may god bless you both and your family take care loveredhea      
if take a medication improve the quality of your life and sanity then you should take it especially with a low dosage you would be recommend to take most drs be against medication during pregnancy especially for mental issue   they look at a cha and immediately insist it be a terrible idea if you or your doctor have any concern a specialist will be likely recommend they have train staff that measure and track all growth fluid etc regularly   I lower my dosage of some of my medication and immediately resume the normal level after my child be bear my child be healthy and I be well able to take care of her   benefit vs risk   if you be able to deal with your illness without medication then obviously do it   but you do not have to suffer unnecessarily because of pressure or fear   your child will not have withdrawal or last impact from that   but the rammification of discontinue a medication pregnant can effect your ability to adequately care for and bond with your baby   it be not noble or more responsible or more natural or whatever kind of misinformation will say to suffer
when I decide I want to get pregnant I wean myself off my antidepressant first I do not risk it
I can not remember what I take but my kid be both fine   I go off to breastfeed but could not do it I be so full of anxiety I stop breastfeed and go back on med   good luck you get this
in health care there be adage when the benefit outweigh the risk the risk be woh take only you can decide personally I would take the medication yes the baby might have health issue but you will be there to take care of your bundle of joy god bless and good luck
I be on lamictal for my bipolar when I be pregnant my son cam out perfectly healthy but here be the thing my doctor give I a choice and say my son could come out with a cleft lip so I go to an herbal drug store and staed take fish oil as it help skin to grow and stay healthy and I also take omega for his brain activity and a few other herbal pill if you be unsure about your medication I would suggest take over the counter pill like the fish oil and vitamin b help with your mood too of course be bipolar and have depression it will not do as much as your med will but maybe try n stay at the same dose and add vitamin b to it good of luck to you and your little one
I stop my medication as soon I find out I be pregant I do not want to risk it   I just increase my therapy session
the only medicine I could take when I be pregnant be latuda and buspar neither do I any good I stae before I be stay on during miscarry my child still stay on they and end up in the hospital to be put on other med I have bipolar anxiety ptsd and ocd and adhd tendency by whatever test that they put I through I be not on generic topimax cymbalta trazidone and have to go to talk therapy every week and meet with psychiatrist every   week so depend on each person individual chemistry to be honest and if you have any other health condition as well
I be on zoloft most pregnancy with both of my boy   they stae I at   mg both time my last pregnancy I be at   mg by the time I give bih neither boy have any side effect the only side effect my ob be worried about for baby be irritability for my son have two different doc with my boy after he be bear neither of my boy have irritability I also breastfe both boy   my old be adhd and have anxiety but there be a ton of mental illness on both side   I have bipolar disorder gad adhd and ptsd   zoloft do not work the great but it ceainly help take the edge off it be one of those thing where you weigh risk to benefit   I would do your research before you sta a medication check the study do on the medication   yes you do need to think of baby first but stress be not good on the baby either   stress can have side effect on the baby too    from sho to long term effect   if you do take a ssri be sure to watch out for maniahypermania   be on only an ssri can cause bout of mania I be a type   but I do not really have issue during pregnancy   do what be good for you and baby whatever you decide be something that should be respect you be a wonderful mother   everyone be different and deal with their mental illness differently
I take a low dose of celexa and everything be fine you have to be in a good state of mind I think a low dose be fine you do not want to be miserable or stress the baby out with depression which can lead into bad thing such as not eat and panic attack increase hea rate or dehydration sometimes the benefit of the medicine outweigh the risk if you need the medicine and it be a small dose like it be I say it be fine
effexor the last trimester and for   year nursing mg he be fine and   nowhe do not have any adhd or any other disorder the hormone really make depression and anxiety hard with my first I go free of medication but for my second baby I choose medication I be able to have some control over my depression and be more calm and present for my baby
I do not take any med while pregnant it be   safe no worry about bih defect or anything for my baby
agree some people be so judgemental I be on a low dose of celexa and everything be fine sometimes the benefit of the medicine outweigh the risk I mean it be be different if it be a class c medicine but she be on a low dose
I be on   mg of zoloft while pregnant its perfectly safe and ask for latuda its a medicine use to treat bipolar and its safe for pregnant and nursing mother be pregnant with my son on both and nurse he on both they would want to reduce the zoloft at maybe   week so that your baby do not suffer from withdrawal he might be extra sleepy or fussy or a bit shaky as a result I be actually pregnant right now too almost   month my psychiatrist have I on haldol its low risk for pregnancy it make I really sleepy but I have almost no meltdown anymore its the good medicine I have ever be on good luck mama and hug
I be currently   week pregnant and I stop take my zoloft I be struggle with my depression but I be try to work through it I do not want to cause my baby any damage
I take latuda and buspar with my last pregnancy for bipolar and anxiety latuda work great but after I have my baby I stae have a reaction to it this be my nd pregnancy and be only on buspar the other med lamictal which be okay for pregnancy I have a reaction to as well I do go to group   time a weel as well good luck
before I become pregnant I go to see a reproductive toxicologist because I be on effexor and do not want any adverse affect to the baby he say that ssris and ssnris because no more damage than the   chance of any bih defect in a normal pregnancy my son have no withdrawal symptom and receive my breast milk for seven month that have my medication in it as well mood stabilizer like depakote can cause bih defect maois can cause bih defect as well as anti psychotic you should not worry about zoloft the doctor say to I that it be impoant to have a healthy mother you need to be eat and sleep   be suicidal be not healthy for a pregnancy be safe and be well and may you have a healthy baby
I have be try to conceive for age now I be on zolfot mg and quitiapal mg at night and mg when require be I go to continue to struggle because of my med
I can not take antidepressant at all I have epilepsy so there be very few med I can take but I be on buspar for my anxiety and lamotragine for my bipolar I be also   month pregnant with my th kid be pregnant with all these problem be probably one of the bad feeling in the world you have your moment of happiness then severe depression for long than the up you have to fight each day to get through it I be probably one of the few people on here who can not take anything really get yourself a strong circle of friend try work on new thing to keep yourself busy bad case scenario try look into more home remedy natural thing like aromatherapy healing stone and crystal herbal tea stuff like that its work for I
depend on if the benefit outweigh the risk in my case they do
I be bipolar   and I can not stop my med so I have to accept that I will not have a second child anyway I just have to remember my last pregnancy and the first year of my son life and I think it be well this way I do nott want that my son suffer from ny illness depression high anxiety etc I be not a doctor but my psychiatrist always tell be that you can not take any med when your pregnant I do not think you should take that risk   good luck

I be bipolar   and a therapist currently on zoloft although you may continue with it throughout pregnancy remember that stress can also affect your pregnancy you need to be in the good state of mind for your baby try some yoga and definitely see a therapist regularly there be app you could download like happify or fabulous even reach out just like you do now be impoant keep you and your baby safe ask your doctor about natural alternative whole food have some I believe
wow rachel   it be good to listen to your doctor as the med you be on might not have be ok while pregnant   however to call the rest of we dumb fuck be out of line we all weigh the risk of our med against the risk to the babys development there be med your doctor could have switch you to that be safe tell someone to go unmedicated be like tell they it be ok to feel uncontrolled suicidal thought which put they at a high risk of death that it be never ok   we mom that take medication while pregnant and while nursing be put our child life first and our to be able to be there for our child there be no dumb fuck here only educate mom
well I will listen to my drs they know more than any of you I have research which be safe and which be not so to all of you on med whilst pregnant I hope your happy with yourself for put your child at risk you stupid fuck
lithium be not safe my dr refuse to use lithium while I be pregnant because of too many risk say if I want to go that direction I have to sign a waiver state I know the risk because that be not something he practice I could not do it I understand be stable trust I it be an everyday battle for everyone but never in a million year would I stay on treatment and risk the life of my child it be a small window of time to not be on med with the right suppo you can get through without med you just have to know what suppo you really need and different med do different thing during different phase of pregnancy I have be on some that be safe after first trimester and I have be on some that be only safe during the first trimester
sometimes people need to be on medication and that be less risky often than have a relapse lithium safe after wks and other med have a low risk of problem it be st trimester when it be imp to be off med if possible advise although I be ok with out any
I do not even know it be think to be ok to continue psych med while pregnant so when I decide to get pregnant I wean myself off before I even staed try I be not go to risk something go wrong with my baby because of my med
founately   I be not on med when I be pregnant    I battle my disorder in silence   I do not know if I be woh listen to but if you can hold off increase the med I think you should   I know what your go thru to some degree   and it be definitely tough   I have many disorder include bipolar    there be many side affect that affect we let alone a baby   I believe the med could have some affect   it would scare I   I hope you find peace in whatever you do   my prayer be with you   god bless
I stop all med when I be pregnant then continue they after I have baby so I be not able to breastfeed and thing be hard during my pregnancy but to I the bad day be woh know that I be do what be good for my kid and not take chance I understand why some woman opt to stay on med but for I it just be not a risk I be willing to take and while I have suicidal thought I know that I never would act on they while I be pregnant so I just deal with everything until baby be bear and continue therapy
I be on pristiq for depressionanxiety my entire pregnancy and end up go up dosage to mgday the only issue bubba would have face be possibly some lung issue but as long as they be aware of it they would be prepare to handle it he be bear via c section   week early as he be kgpo and I have a lot of fluid the big risk to his health be actually my gestational diabetes not my med I be tell that I would be able to breastfeed and stay on my med and that would actually be beneficial to bubba as would reduce his withdrawal symptom I make the decision myself to bottle feed I do try breast feed initially but I think c section and be separate from he while he be in special care for   day do not help while a small pa of I miss bf   you still get the closeness and contact while bottle feeding and it also allow your paner to have a hand in it too   please talk to your gppsychobstetric dr about possible side effect for you and bubba my drs keep talk about good outweigh risk at the end of the day it be how you feel too if you feel the anxiety of be on med and possible risk will be bad for you than tell your drs that   here if you need it mumma
so you believe pregnant mother who choose to take their doctor advice   stay on the minimum dose of med that science   research have deem safe to use will still have baby that be more likely to develop those disorder you mention   that be funny because I do not drink any alcohol smoke take med eat shellfish ceain cheese cut of meat etc etc etc whatever be popular at the time to not do   still constantly change today during all   of my pregnancy yet my   boy be both diagnose with asd autism spectrum disorder adhd attention deficit hyperactivity disorder   gad generalised anxiety disorder   my daughter be diagnose with add attention deficit disorder   so there you go even mother who think they have do everything right still have special need child your ignorance be obviously bliss for you but for those who through no fault of their own be still give bih to   raise special need child it be not so blissful   want to know the actual truth   even science do not know how or can explain what cause such disorder   so how can you think you have any idea

I be on   mg of zoloft my whole pregnancy I have a lot more appointment ultrasound just to keep an eye out for anything badwhich I be fine I be also bipolar I cold turkey my xanax though because I be diagnose with anxiety which be difficult but I be fine on my zoloft and they pay a lot of attention to I be pregnant on it as for the breast feed I could not produce milk so I can not help you on that topic
amanda any baby can show those sign as each and every baby be as singular and individual as adult be   research the hell out of the subject speak to multiple doctor specialist and make sure that you see a psychiatrist as oppose to a psychologist regard medication   they be the one who be train in that area make sure that you know what can happen what a safe dose during pregnancy be and how to handlewhat to do if your baby do have withdrawal etc though realistically if your baby be have withdrawal heshe will be stay in the hospital so that it can be manage in a safe and nonlife threaten way just because someone else who have take do not have any issue it do not mean that you will not and vice versa only you know what be good for you and your baby however if you be have suicidal thought I would be inclined to stay on the zoloft and to increase as your psych deem fit you will have a whole team of doctor psych obgyn and perinatalpostnatal specialist look after both you and your baby pre and post bih to ensure both of your safety and need be take care of have an indepth discussion with your psych   write out any and all question that you have before your next appointment and take that list with you so that you may address your concern properly good luck sweethea redheaxxx
I be worried when I first find out I quit zoloft cold turkey too and they make I go back on it they tell I that be the first thing they normally put pregnant woman on like I say they watch over I and I have a lot more appointment but she come out happy and healthy
eletric shock therapy    it use to be popular till we finally get some effective drug you lose some of your memory when they do it   I talk to patient who undergo it when I be consider it I decide the risk be too great instead I fly from wa to ca to enter a hospital just for mental health there be a ton of facility for alcoholic and drug abuser and not enough for mental health
I be biploar    I would not touch psych med while I be pregnant or breastfeed I have a friend who be bipolar    she have to come off med under drs supervision with every pregnancy   just risk the mood she be advise to bottle feed in order to get back on her med as soon as possible keep research these be serious med   
I be take mg of zoloft but I try my hard and wait until I be in the middle of my nd trimester where all his major organ be develop already it be really hard during the time I be off all medication but for I the benefit outweigh the risk sometimes it can do more damage if you be anxious and depressed   good of luck xx

live with bipolaranxiety and panic attack
I can totally empathise it be heabreake see your child really struggle with life the only advice I can offer be no matter what make sure your lecturer in son know you love and suppo he and will be there for he no matter what which be easy to day but not always easy to do my son go through extreme period of aggression verbal and physical and say some incredibly   huful thing which I really struggle with but I try to remember it be not he thing be much well now but I still look out for the tell tale sign its vital that   you have good suppo too
I have bipolar anxiety depression schizophrenia and adhd I be diagnose when I be   yrs old I be   now first I do not know who be say smoke weed but grow up second go for a walk I believe that be the most relaxing and calm for I no one be the same so try anything that take your mind off thing idc what it be write draw work gardening etc I think you get the idea I actually go thru a period of my young life I do not know how old you be but again everyone be different mine be severe anxiety and depression and the adhd have a role also if you be just stae these symptom now but I doubt it because I know at age of   or   something be not right whatever happen at dr be honest that be the only way the doc can help if med be prescribe take they some take a couple week to kick in other take   wks also if you have bad reaction and be bad or a reaction happen immediately tell doc I be go to let you know you might not like this dr and heshe might dope you up I go thru literally upto this day   drs take    year to get my right combo it be go tobe tough but hang in there to this day even with med I still have episode very far between though med be not a cure they be a pa of your cope skill they be not be not a cure when you find out what be actually go on do what you be suppose to do and keep do it this also impoant you can not be comfoable with the dr get a new one you must be able to not be afraid to tell all that dr say no your ok time to get a new one if that dr say same maybe it be something hormonal   man get unbalanced also stay away from alcohol drug etc they be not help they will make it bad god bless you   and I know you will find that inner peace livelovelaugh
sue you be exactly right this be why I say read up and get knowledge jay and eric both need more knowledge on this thc be a good pain releaver and be prove weed be prove to cause anxiety   paranoia and depression get your fact correct and until you both show I evidence from a source stop give advice obviously you both know nothing about
no read about it and weed cause in some paranoia and anxiety stop say this I be not try to be a ass but stop ty
see a psychiatrist and try to get to the core of your anxiety she will probably want to see you regularly and prescribe anti anxiety med
this be a symptom of anxiety refer to the book dsm talk it over with your health professional
omg this have be happen to I too my dr think it be pa of the anxiety and then it get bad and I be diagnose with esophagitis
I have the same problem when I be have an anxiety attack I go through the motion of throw up usually nothing come up unless I just eat I be finally on clonidine klonopin and atarax have not have an episode since I have feel like I be go to have an anxiety attack I stave it off by lie down or talk myself through it or go to the bathroom and wait it out
I also do the gagging and throw up when I have anxiety I try to ground myself and think of the positive stop it you be in my thought and prayer hug peace victoryhand
I have an issue with gaggingdry heaving I do not think it have to do with my anxiety though I just have a habit of make sure I always eat in the morning before takin my med lithium so it would not hu my stomach as the few time I do make that mistake it be not a fun morning for I I think my body just kind of associate I not eat in the morning with my experience of takin med without food and trigger a response even though I do not actually take my med never happen after I eat a good meal in the morning
could be med or from anxiety try supplement that help calm like ashwaghanda
I have the same problem I be think its bad when anxiety be high and med I be take seraquel it seem to be make I sick with nausea and light head and dizzyness go to have the doctor take I off on the next appointment scared to just stop on my own and scare its somthe else wrong
I might just have to go in as a walk in which be a pain because it take a couple of hour atleast how long do the side affect last I can not handle too much long need to find out if its the pill or scare its allergic reaction or some other illness
I have the same problem in the morning I gag and feel sick to my stomach   I wish I know why I mean be this pa of anxiety
wellbutrin be an upper make my anxiety kick into overdrive too often my bipolar be much more manic than depressive then the valium throw your body back the other way the body be constantly try to find balance because those   drug together pull the body different way
good luck just make your future the good you can I no it be hard when you feel guilt from your past xxxx
welbutrine give I panic attack but we be all wire different
yike   a lot of anti anxiety med   I take wellbutrin in morning be careful with valium very addictive and dangerous my opinion so talk to your doctor about itredhea
be all you guy mostly base in america   it be real hard get medication off the drs here in england he put I on seraline mg daily   off the book and all it do be stop the hysterical crying I still have anxiety attack I still go into mad rage still have day where I just want to be a million mile away from everyone still have the crazy dream and I still have so much go on in life that I have to get through
I have be on mg lamictal for year and will never change from that the only thing I find that work for I be seroquel xr along with due to depression and anxiety I use benedryl yo go to sleep every night I be try melatonin for something different lamictal at night also and that make I groggy
my doctor use wellbutrin to bring I out of depression never for mania in fact she watch my dosage carefully so mania be not trigger I be bipolar one I use to be on lamictal for awhile it work well I guess every doc have their way of do the med I just know if I get too much wellbutrin I become jiddery and anxious good luck
I be on mg of wellbutrin   trazadone mg times a day of buspar mg of lithium   mg of proxasin can not spell so I honestly do not know what be work on what be not I be a recover drug addictalcoholic so I can not take narcotic anymore I have cycothymia ptsd add generalized anxiety disorder I feel like I be on too much shit but everyone be different and how they respond to med it be hard to really get advice on that topic I hope wellbutrin help you go thru med change and have mental health issue and deal with the mental health world be shitty if you ask I I be just try to make it in life and keep fight
oh bless you I be also a recover alcoholic and drug addict   no benzodiazepine for sure I too have to be wean off xanax but like you not until I be well enough from alcohol I have be on many combination of med and the last   year the right one for I I be bipolar major depression catastrophic anxiety panicky etc but sober for   year
I be also a recover alcoholic I have be on xanax for   year at this point only   week sober he do not want I to detox off this drug just yet I be also bi polar   ptsd anxiety
my history be very similar to yours the disease damage your ability to manage your life properly not you per say I be tell I be grieve the loss of who I be before this disease take hold I also take and anti seizure med tegretol which have help immensely however I be also on valium for anxiety and sleep I also take ambien for sleep this med be the one that truly make a difference I have be on wellbutrin and buspar and sadly really never help everyone need their own specific cocktail to be effective I wish you all the good if you find yourself in hell keep goingwinston churchill this quote have help I   laugh and to keep move forward I wish the same for youheaexclamation
the only advice I have be watch for mania since you have just be manic antidepressant can cause mania I be on wellbutrin mg and it work well for I but I be bp I also take buspar mg three time a day for anxiety and in the past I have be on lamictal
it be very dangerous to discuss medication with people who be not professional but my two cent be that wellbutrin be either heaven or hell for I it be hell it give I these episode where it feel like my entire body be buzz and crawl with ant or something and I could not sit still it be horrible but I have many customer for who it work very very well too
I do not want to sleep   see I get ptsd bi polar   severe anxiety severe depression   for sleep I be stick sleep bring nightmare n night terror when I be awake I have flashback so I be double fuck   then   bi polar n anxiety n depression hit so that be a double wammy   no wonder there be time I just want to end it all but I keep fight second by second so I can do it all over again to see another day   to sta it all over again
this   when you be scared to close your eye at night   and when you open they the next morning you think oh shit not again
it can be so hard   as the other post suggest they can not be push   recovery from anxiety or depression can feel so painfully slow for the sufferer and those close to they   I be in a similar position with a son the same age   the most impoant thing I learn be for they be to know they can rely on you   not to push they too far too fast not to falter not to give up and to be there   other come and go some do not understand this be where the loneliness can come in for they when they feel they be different not cope or when their friend do not have time for they   when they feel they can t control the mental illness when it do not make sense when it take over and they can not see it get any well the one person they usually need to count on be their mum   even though they be a young adult they be still young still vulnerable and still need a huge amount of suppo gentle encouragement to move forward of course be necessary but it have really to be govern by they at the pace they feel comfoable with hopefully small achievable step will lead on to more   every achievement however small it might seem to other will hopefully spur they on draw on past evidence to help they see they be do well they be move forward one paicularly bad time with we be the eve of a big school trip early this year the first one in the whole of his schooling he feel able to go on   at the last minute he could not go it be too big for he   I try everything in my power to convince he to go I think it be time to throw in the towel I think if he could not do that he d never be able to do anything   he just say mum I need you to understand if I have not get you on my side I have get nothing it be just too big to do at this time please do not make I I quickly learn an impoant lesson   at this point in his life it be too much for he to cope with he explain it do not mean that sometime in the future he might feel strong enough   he be go on to secure a job recently which be beyond my wildest dream I never think it possible to overcome the anxiety of an interview anything be possible but of course it be not easy mental illness be debilitate sometimes it be heabreake to see a love one go through it we can feel so powerless when as a parent we want to fix and protect the hard thing be we can not always do that good wish and good luck x apology some of the punctuation on my ipad will not work
marilyn corrado sorry hun do not mean to upset you but I also understand how emotional it all be and how big a toll it take on we all   your son sound as though he have the good parent all we can do be try our good they will always know how much you have help they   we put our hea and soul into suppoe our child regardless of age and yes as you say it can feel such a solitary journey sometimes but I be sure as a family you be a strong unit and I be sure you will all do your utmost to ensure he have a happy future stay strong hold on to your dream x thank you for your kind word too I will walk over hot coal for my child the other one be profoundly deaf so they both still need a huge amount of suppo but we ll soldier on take good care of yourself too that be so impoant x
my husband have a very hard time except it we see our other two son thrive in life one have his phd and the other be a comic who suffer from depression and anxiety but still can deal with it   after year of counsel his therapist say to home school he my husband say each day when we drive he to school be like take he to a funeral   he want so bad for he to be normal   our son from day one be different from the other two   do I want he to be normal yes do I want he to be happy yes do we all still have hope yes   but for now it be what it be and one day I hope there be a great advancement in drug or treatment   he be a wonderful caring young man and be willing to be a guinea pig he want to get well he hope he will get well   but for now we just wait and live this way   god bless
some heavy pain you be carry there I be go to try and respond to the aspect you have mention as well as I can firstly I do not think anybody here will ever say they know what you be go through we all know that every person condition be different we might have similar diagnosis but how that condition affect you be not how it affect I friend and family who say this be most likely only try to be there for you sadly it can feel as an insult but there be nothing you can do about other people with regard to your people please behaviour well I have find that most of those suffer from a mental condition be in fact always people pleaser we give unconditionally to the point where it drain we it be hard to focus only on yourself because you do not want to feel selfish take it from a person who use to be a doormat look after yourself and if you have time and energy you can see if you can help other lonely wanderer well I think it sum up many of we here our condition trap we in our mind and it be a lonely place personally I have no friend either this be by choice as I have ceain expectation from anybody who want to be in my close circle I do not trust easily due to the once bite twice shy syndrome do it bother I not in the least faith and belief yeah well what can I say for some it work personally I want to vomit in my mouth when people tell I to pray etc I have see and experience too much in my life to believe in anything that can not be prove suicidal thought at be bad we all have to deal with they how you do that be up to you do it matter that other do not appreciate you deal with it on your own hell no if it work for you then they can go fly a kite do people care about your pain maybe but at the end of the day most people be selfish and care about their own issue only   we all get tired of fight this endless battle in fact I have be stable for   year yet after almost die last month come home to the same shit I actually wish I never survive do it make I weak no the fact that I be still here mean that I be a tough cookie than most people anyhoo I know I can not take the pain and frustration away from you but I hope that you will be able to see that even though we be all alone essentially we be also surround by million who be fight alongside we to survive through their pain
why take yourself off med not every manic episode be a fun   you will crash and get sicker do not risk feel stable
I know how you feel I feel like my med be control my mania but because of that I be just in a mildly depressed state all the time   I hate it I be so tired and unmotivate   the problem be I go super paranoid and have to be hospitalize when the mania go too far but yeah I would rather be manic than depress any day the challenge be to find that healthy middle they call normal good luck congrat on get back to work   but please do not go off your med keep work with your doctor and get counseling

it be all new too I and I struggle as well I try use comedy movie to distract
I also suffer from depression and anxiety and have suicidal thought and image sometimes daily I have try to accept it be a pa of I but I still have good day and bad day
I have both as well it really be shitty the doctor be right that be how we be wire sta a journal and each day keep track of your mood any suicidal ideation if you become obsessed with this go to hospital immediately
doctor be so full of shit its unbelievable they can not even dispence the right medicine get away from those negative quack you be a hell of a lot well and saer than they be listen to your hea not your mind I know I have be there and I hate it when all those thought come into my mind I shake it off breath deep and think of positive stuff it help a lot than shitty doctor
I have both bpd and bipolar disorder   with psychotic feature ptsd and ga I have struggle hard with suicidal ideation my psychiatrist have never tell I I will always have those thought the last time I have a bad depression I be on the verge of become homeless I fight suicidal ideation for two month straight I even write a suicide note when I tell my psychiatrist he do not even bat an eye no med adjustment I have get through the crisis myself without go to hospital the thing be I completely be suicidal and it all hedge on if I could find a place to live or not I be disabled it be january I have just lose my van in the summer and be not move by choice I have pet a mobility scooter and my son back out of share a place with I at the last minute I can not afford a place on my own I live in the third most expensive place to rent a one bedroom in canada my daughter could only take I for two week or lose her rent subsidy and possibly get evict so that be out I have nowhere to go I have be homeless before and I just do not have the strength to do it again to lose everything again and end up in a tiny room without my pet be just too much for I I plan it of course the day I be to surrender my dog to a rescue I get the call that my now roommate and I be approve for a place I have plan on not wake up the next morning but I digress your therapist say you will always have those thought my psychiatrist never even address it and no I can not just get another doc there be a doctor shoage here people do not have doctor and be go to walk in clinic and the hospital because they have no doctor I do not think I will ever get past have those thought I just hope I never act on they this january be the close I have be in several year to it
it do happenwith bipolar one you be more dangerous to yourself and could end up badly hue yourself with bipolar two it be more self harmbut with medication and alot of positive thought you can copejust tell yourself when you in a bad situation this be my sickness tomorrow I will wake up and feel betterit a roller coaster our ability to copebut as any sickness we have to learn to cope and be strongbe good to yourself find thing you enjoy do not worry about the past and what hu you or break you just live each day as it come and it will get well
I use to suffer multiple suicidal thought every single day for over year and sometimes I would act on they I be also borderline and bipolar with adhd since be on seroquel quetiapine I can go month without the thought and when I do get they they be only fleeting it have be pure bliss not have that daily struggle I still hate I but seroquel have be a godsend for alleviate those thought I also stae lithium   month ago to help alleviate the up n down of bipolarso far so good
I think it be a very hard thing to hear but it be the truth   I be not bipolar but I do struggle with intense depression and anxiety   I struggle daily with suicidal thought and   want to cut myself   but at least a professional be tell you it be normal instead of make you seem crasy like everyone make I feel insane or dramatic I would love to find someone who will take I seriously and understand my pain hu sadness despair and sorrow I be very very suicidal but no one make I feel ok about it
my counselor say that I be border personality throw I for a loop by umpteenth yrs of be tell I be bipolar with anxiety tendency when I be tell I be bordline personality with agroaphoic
seem a bit harsh to tell you you will always have they they may be pa of who you be now but mental illness be a journey and you may experience change for the well with practice and time that say emotion be never wrong they just be all you can do be choose whether or not you encourage a feeling by dwell on it or choose to   reevaluate your thought process and try to gain a different perspective suicidal thought be a reaction to difficult and painful feeling you have the power to change how you react to your feeling even if you can not directly change the feeling itself your mind be plastic and regenerative thought pattern can become habitual but habit can be relearn
it be the harsh truth for some people it make the fight easy for other not so much if your therapist be a good one they tell you for a reason for I personally know it be just a pa of my brain and not a pa of who I be as a person be extremely helpful I know when to reach out when it get too difficult to handle myself because I will always have they and that be okay well to learn how to handle it rather than make it a constant struggle to fix it
to be honest I would be relieve to hear this from a professional every time I have be open about these thought be my default I wake up with a hefty hospital bill I do not have any plan it be just a pa of my life that I deal with I can not tell you that you will always have these thought because I be not here to play armchair psychologist but maybe the finality of what the doctor be say be disturb to some deal with bipolar and borderline be tough it be work every single day of your life you be fight I know I be some day it exhaust I so much that these thought resurface at the forefront of my mind but once again as long as I do not have a plan they be not a because for alarm to I personally
kristi dietz thank you so much for this comment we be not alone in this struggle bipolar disorder never give I a rest and I think you put it well when you describe how all it be a daily exhausting struggle talk yourself down or up all day long we be planner through and through haha
I agree with you instant inpatient it be almost like my suicide ideation be one of my cope skill when shit get super hard I have have they for   year sometimes I   sta to conjure up a plan but I also have a plan in place to stop plan I be very organized in my planning lol but not really lol it be a daily exhausting struggle talk yourself down or up all day long sometimes you just feel like ugh this be ridiculous and you yearn for peace and rest how I perceive these ideation I just get sick of the fight I be tired where be my easy button because med just take the edge off I would like pretty please and easy carefree day fill with magical mermaid and sweet ta     l
true but chance be high if it be always on the forefront of one mind mine be like that I hit one stressful situation and attempt suicide I be still so close to do it again and it feel like I get even close with each pass day I just want the thought to stop
I be tired I love my kid I love my grandkid but I be tired tired of fight it be a lose battle everyday be a struggle scare who you go to piss off scared to open your mouth scared of what somebody might say about you it be a lose battle I be so tired of it all
my mania be not enjoyable it be anger irritability a nd feeling like I be just go to completely go over the edge it be so horrible any body else experience this
I love it until I get irritable if I do not have kid I would not be on med
I hope to have manic episode because it make I very active not need so much sleep and more obsessive as in clean I miss those episode wish I know how to trigger mine
I usually enjoy my manic phase during they I be more social energetic and productive but afterwards I   tend to be self conscious and anxious about the thing I   may have say or do
just come off of a   week episode of mania or hypomania whatever it be   I love it for all the same reason we all do but know I can not keep up with it all forever but sure wish I could no fear of the world at all then I sta to get irritated by everything under the sun   then the ugly depression come I have many more episode of depression than mania and would give anything for it to be reverse
I would always much rather be manic than depressive but when I be manic I be very irritable and honestly just a bitch but I be try my good to calmly tell myself I be over react
manicdepresse paranoia psychosis I hate all of it doctor visit therapist   paial hospitalization hospitalization med change provider change cost for treatment and med loss of all relationship isolation weight change insomnia nonfunctional wrong diagnosis dual diagnosesi be on the damn good ship lollipop
I enjoy that I feel more motivated and less numb but I also dread my more manic time because I make split second decision and be often irrational and compulsive which have get I into trouble before
I like it but the irritability bother I some and the cockyness of I not care what my decision do to my family bother I but not enough to stop I do it I live at the bottom of the wave so much that surf the top right now I just want to ride and let loose I know I will crash bit until then surfs up
nope as much time as people like we spend selfloathe and wallow in mental and emotional misery it be nice to let loose and just do our own thing when our shittybogitty brain let we
I enjoy mine but it also scare the crap out of I especially know the crash be come fast I between the time I do not sleep have great idea get thing do that have be loom for a long time I be also very defensive more combative and easily irritated and willing to act irrationally or run away
love the productive and creative side of mania   hate the irritability and conflict that it bring though
I take seroquel to stop the mania and lagactil which be an old drug epilim be well than lithium as it do not strain the kidney
after read this ian like this but my doc say I only have anxiety and depression I have high   and think nothing of do anything and feel fab then the low when I do not want   to speak to anyone and shut myself away I get in trouble at work and   beacuse    I do I think people be talk about I
that be pretty universal for at least pa of the experience   after a while be out of control can be very terrifying
mania be ok until I end up completely paranoid and psychotichearing voice and see thing be not welcome addition to my mania
I do not because while at time it make I feel confident and fantastic   at   other time it make I quite agitated and irritable and I can be huful when I be that type of manic
usually when I be manic be when I go into spiral uncontrollable rage too not one thing fun about that either
I use to love it until they work their way into crazy mania which get I into trouble or I drop dramatically into suicidal low suddenly or I go from manic to paranoid psychotic wonder what reality actually be   yeah I have some mania which be just great fun very productive lot of energy creative positive about everything and everyone fun fun fun I do enjoy they a lot have not have a mania for   year now due to take medication and I like stability a lot more the low which follow be awful and I be finally not seem to have they anymore either first few year of med no mania but lot of low mania be fun but personally I be like stable a lot more
I find it very stressful because my behavior during these time do not match who I really be   I have try conventional med and be very resistant to they therefore I be no long on anything I have lose people due to my behavior and I do not blame they do not mean they be well than I I take it as one can only take what I dish out for so long I have find and this be not for other to do without their doctor guidance be that I be well control without prescribe med it do have its downfall as in I be more isolated but I also do not make an ass of myself be this balance probably not but it keep I from take people on my mental rollercoaster at least for now
it be the most dangerous pa of be bipolar you can bring it down and manage it with seroquel and lagactil and other medication it be hard to control your self and you can loose a lot of friend great creativity but often it just feel like you be busy but you do not actually get anything do not that I have try these drug but I think it be like be on lsd and cocaine at once yes we like it yes we manage it when you see that look of horror in other people eye when you be talk to they with manic pressured speech give they some space and take a little extra medication to come down
I think most do however it give I anxiety and I do not for the most pa I have recurrent depression which be even more awful but with the med I be on I tolerate it and I be well if I do the work to stay that way
I completely understand but hate the shame or embarrassment I feel after
everyone be different I hate it I get aggressive and mean and grouchy and really anxious and that be not to mention all the stupid decision I make like shopping and stuff
I enjoy be productive and more creative the feeling of not care what other think be good too but I always fall back into depression before I can finish what I staed I tend to have a million thing go on at once and none of they complete when I be feel depress all of that tend to make I feel overwhelmed guilty and disgusted with myself so it be a toss up I only like be manic in the moment
I can see how it look and I get down on myself when it happen    but sometimes everything seem too heavy too much too overwhelming
I be so glad that you find a doctor that be willing to look more into thing rather than just state that its a product of your mental health disorder I be really struggle with the medication that I be take because it seem like a never end cycle I know I need the med to remain stable but I do not feel like I reach stability yet as my med continue to be adjust
thank for share   I have try to over dose   time   each time I feel so alone and it would never feel well   praise god it do but it take change med suppo from friend and family and some time to let it happen   I be stable today and I have be for about   month   I be a little stress now because we be change a med because of weight gain I pray it work   god bless you your do great
I suffer for year with an extremely low mood and have try to kill myself on more than one occasion my thyroid be also out of range and despite supplement etc I end up have my thyroid remove   year ago I now take thyroxine daily along with my med for depression and anxiety the difference this have make to my low mood be dramatic do not get I wrong I still suffer with bout of low mood but they be not as bad and be not all the time anymore please do not underestimate what a malfunction thyroid can do to your depression as the thyroid regulate an awful lot in your body stay strong and safe xx
thank you vicki early   I try a paleo diet to see if it help my mood   I have amazing result until I have several stressful life event all around the same time   I crash big time   just do not get well because I be so unwell I stop cook   eat nutrient dense food   juzt get sicker as I be get my energy back I be back into cooking   do really well on a paleo type diet I truly believe what we eat play a huge role in mental health foodasmedicine
I be just hang in there minute by minutehope this fear and these worry will go awayplease god help I
god dammit boogie no one want to fuck pain well in inverseness they do figure out what work for you as a healing mechanism its here but to dwell on pain and it become your master and dominate your thought process be just patheticpain be pa of life pain be not life pa not whole excuse I ill be in my hole or whole or whatever
I be currently on   mg of remeron along with mg seroquel I take both at night due to both induce sleep I be diagnose   year ago and have struggle to find the right med for I to feel close to normal and function to the good of my ability I have be on seroquel for   year try remeron be the good thing that have happen to I   I have be on the combo for almost   year and be happy than I have be on any other med and I be lucky enough not to experience the side effect of weight gain
never try itdo any of you get nightmare that be so real I be tour by they to the fact that I jump up cover in sweat and have to sit for a while look around I work out where I be then worry all day that maybe it be a premonition oooh awful xxxxb
still struggle nothing work I could just be a total piece of shit in reality regardless of my medication
be it like a physical anxiety   jittery in leg or both leg and arm   may be you be suffer from the side effect of restless leg syndrome or akathesia   call the doc right away
I take seroquel at night to help I sleep it be be wonderful for my insomnia the first couple of month I have restless leg syndrome but that have taper off
ya and it do not help my anxiety and panic attack

anxiety do not make you do anything you choose to react to it thusly it be you who make these choice I know because I have experience all of this and more and change it all too by choose to be honest and realize I be in control at all time I be not a victim

if you have never experience anxiety   you will never get it

omg I just love and thank you for this post I take depakot as well and my hair have fall out horribly I use to have real thick hair not so much anymore I be go to talk to my doc about this sadly I might have to stay on it it be pa of my med combo a combo that be work for I right now and it be hard to get I on a cocktail that work I have bipolar   thank again for this post
I too experienced hair loss with depakote what happen be it take a while for the depakote to sta the hair loss doubt seriously it have anything to do with the name brand or the generic   selenium be suppose to help decrease the hair loss but I find it continue unabated until I stop the medication   and my hair be never as thick again after the hair loss   I keep the hair in a ziplock bag because I know they doctor would just write it off when I bring in a full bag of hair they could see why I be upset and request a medication change

friend should not make you feel terrible   that be not a friend   I do not know who that be but you should probably either tell they to knock it off or dump they from your life   you do not need that   actual friend do not walk away just because you be have issue   that be not a good friend either   they may need to set boundary that be healthy and appropriate so they do not get overstress or burn out deal with your mood swing but they do not just walk away   that will make you feel bad and it seem like you do not need to feel any bad   your actual friendshave you try reach out to they again   apologize and explain where you be mentally   if they be really your friend they will come back to you   as for your familydo you have grandparent a cousin or an aunt you can go to if your parent have walk away from you   be you get therapy   if not you should definitely be do that for yourself   be you on any med   if so stick with they   if you be feel bad on those medication do not be afraid to tell your therapist that they be not effective   there be a lot of other med they can try until you find something that help with your depression and your anxiety    rememberyou be only    you still have a long life ahead of you where you can make friend who will be there for you   do not give up   my good wish be with you

I be so glad that you come through your surgery it must have be a very traumatic time for you I also wish your health issue be well for you since your surgery   I be sorry I can not offer you any personal experience with cymbalta as I have never take it if you have trust in your doctor though   heshe feel it will help you maybe you should give it a try I guess that unless you try it you will not know any different right can I please ask you a question though   do you feel that your hysterectomy have directly affect your anxiety   depression or do you feel your ongoing health issue be more to blame   I ask this as I can not take the contraceptive pill to stop my period   because the hormone produce during directly affect my bipolar in the bad way my doctor   I be now look into other avenue to stop my period or lessen their impact these include go onto h take oestrogen during period or have a total hysterectomy include ovary remove which as you would be aware also involve h   I have no idea which method will work but I do know that something have to be do as that time of month be without doubt my absolute most dangerous period I be most likely to self harm or suffer such debilitate depression etc that I have very real suicidal idealisation   have attempt in the past as a result any advice or information you can give I about your experience would be very much appreciate I have an appointment next week to find out what the good plan of action my gp   psych have come up with as they plan to speak about this before the appointment I have a close friend who have suffer anxiety for many year but after she be force for other medical reason to have a hysterectomy she have find that the severity of her anxiety symptom have lessen significantly compare to before the surgery as you could imagine I be very anxious   confused as to what to do
melissa maye thank you for tell I your story   for your thought   prayer   I will find out on wednesday what my doctor feel be the good way forward but I do know that I have only   option as I mention above which involve either take oestrogen during my period go onto h or lastly a full hysterectomy include the ovary then h   I would be a fool if I do not admit that I be scared but I do know that something have to be do I can not continue this way
a close friend be prescribe cymbalta for depression   she get some uncomfoable side effect for the first few day so she cease the medication the dr tell she that be quite common   would probably have subside within the week
I have be on cymbalta for three year I actually feel great the drawback however be the side effect I be experience it be apparently affect my nervous system which make I sweat a lot and I mean a lot I be a health care aide and I sweat so badly at work that my scrub top be soak within an hour into my shift it be not a common side effect however I be just unfounate to experience it I just lower my dose which be hard due to the side effect of that the sweating have improve minimally if at all I hope this   help feel free to message I if you want to chat more
I have hear horrible experience
well I take cymbalta I use to be on zoloft and now I take cymbalta and it kind of make I feel like I be on cruise control I do not get upset I do not get angry help my depression a whole lot and I will try to go off of it several time but everytime I do my depression always come back and it be a lot bad people can always tell that be around I that I be not take my medicine so I take the generic brand I get it from kentucky and I get mine for   for a   day supply
they just prescribe I that and I be scared to take any kind of medicine because they give I prozac two week ago and it bring on my depression and suicidal thought so I have to stop it
thank everyone for the feeedback I know that some people be against medication but some people just have to have they I have also be on klonopin for year for my anxiety attack I have be through a very big ordeal I can not even remember be in the hospital or what even happen to I I do not even remember my friend and family even come to visit I I have have a very deep depression and that be just not I I have to at least try something to see if it work my doctor say the patience that he have on the medicine have have a very good success rate with it I also have pain and I understand that it be use for pain as well and as far as give it to god that so have do I pray about my life and my lifes situation quite often imagine go in for a simple procedure and end up in icu on an intebator and then come out with over k dollar in hospital and doctor bill to boot this have also effect my marriage and I just get marry last october so if I have to try a medication for my depression hell it be at least woh a try I just hate side effect but I understand that be a risk with any medication
paula santana so many cook in the kitchen I appreciate that people care but it can all be so muddle if a year or whenever from now you do decide to come off do the   a day method take seven of those tiny bead out of the pill day one   two then   the next two then you get the idea it be tough but I be able to do it note I be back on it after trial   error and a horrid hellacious divorce good luck
you ask about cymbalta     everyone give you all this other advice bless themanywaycymbalta have help I a lot be aware however that come off of be horrid I have never do hard drug but it be what I imagine it be like to come off heroin and anyone else who have come off it can tell you the same this also mean that if I miss a dose I feel it brain zap nausea faint good of luck to you may you feel well very soon
unfounately some time it be the only way chin up thing will get well talk about ptsd med there a blood pressure med help sometimes
prayer about how you be feel really help I and read the bible   psalm be good to read through life up and deep down   david go through horrible trauma and he keep on believe and pray to and trust in god   it help we to do so too   the gospel especially the book of john be really god love letter to we send through jesus
I agree with eric that it be difficult to get off clonipin if feel like I need more and more till I be take   mg a day it take I   month to reduce the dose to   a mg in the morning my dad recently pass away so I go back up on the dose but be now wean my self off it again do we ever not need a crutch in time of high anxiety I do not know how normal people do it
oh I know eric grace I be on xanax for year and year and be put on klonopin instead it help alot with my anxiety though and it help I sleep at night
you have have a traumatic experience and there be another way to look at it   you can choose to reframe it and give thank for your survival   you can thank the lord for survive and come to he for heal   you may need the med to help you get through it but time pass   I can only say this because I have some pretty bad thing happen to I that make I really anxious with panic attack and sky high generalized anxiety that make it really hard to work and do just about everything   I really wish I have take med a lot early in my life   while time go on you do heal   when I be at my bad I have a saying that I tell myself   I use to tell myself that thing would not always be this way and that tomorrow be another day   I like another saying that be   every day be a new beginning   this give I the knowledge that as bad as a day get I could hope for well tomorrow
cymbalta be hell for I increase anxiety time a million body ache very panicky try give it a chance to work but it do not and come off of it be bad after a few day off of it I feel so relieved and much well I have hear the opposite for other people some say it be great   
the different type of cannabis work for different    ailment   indica sativa hybrid etc have to do your research   I have use it for anxiety indica I do not use sativas because they can make I have panic attack hybrid be the variety that be when you need to know name of cannabis and what they do to your mind body I take psych med but have decrease so much that I rely on cannabis for pain management as well
cymbalta help with my anxiety   ache n pain and depression   I wish you well

hi there   sound as though thing be really pretty bad for you at the moment   it must be so tough   there be so many hideous feeling have a mental illness can bring but one of they the incessant worry ruminating analysing must be one of the bad it never seem to stop unless you be lucky enough to have the respite of sleep if it come the torment can feel so great it can be exhaust all encompass and at time debilitate have anxiety and depression can often go hand in hand as one can bring on or worsen the other push people away can be for many reason as you suggest but of course it can also be counter productive   have a mental health problem can make you feel very alone and when you need people the most you can go to any length to almost hide from people these might all be very common trait but know that might not actually help of course you describe that you have be recently diagnose as have bipolar but I be wonder if you have any fuher suppo professional in light of this diagnosis have you be prescribe any medication to help or do you have access to any other suppo eg charity counsel etc   you have clearly be suffer a long time so it worry I in case you be not get the good help but be unsure where you be and therefore which help might be out there   in the youk the samaritan be a very good point of contact for suppo but not sure if you be in the us it be a good thing you have reach out here and there be many caring sol here who understand   understand kindness and consideration can really make the difference when you feel so alone take good care of yourself try to reach out to those who you love x

I have be in this exact situation I confide in someone I think I could trust and the very same day I hear they make fun of my situation to someone else not only be I hu and upset it also cause I to have issue trust people however the positive that come from that is I hand all my problem over to christ cuz I know I can fully trust he and he will guide I in the right direction and I have become a much strong woman
you also have great fear you will be betrayedvery hard to trust an when you do you wish you have not trust

I write about the haze last night   and the hea beat as if a train have just hit a wall the pain be overwhelming to the point of feel like your in the fire not just next to it   yet noone see this all they see be you maybe look melancholy watch twilight when bell be change and noone notice because they think she be dead   that be what its like
I have not work since november of last year we lose our home and have to move with my parent my hubby and two kiddo work be extremely stressful and anxiety provoke I have ptsd from work I apply for ssdi I be wait my decision to see if we need to appeal
my anxiety be so bad I do isolate myself
anxiety be prevent I from work most time not many understand that not physically lazy at all I lose interest really fast
I go through this when I first staed my job it do last about   year you may be different but eventually it do go away it be impoant that you take your medication even if you do feel well like you I hear voice if I do not take my med the anxiety be just another aspect of your illness so you need to take your med just to let you know I have be in my job for   year you can do this to without your medication you be very much on an edge and could trip over at any time the anxiety your feeling about work be because it be new and unknown do not leave yourself vulnerable without your medication   
I hear you work be a major stressor for a lot of people with mental health issue what I have learn be stay in the moment and practice mindfulness stay focused at the task at hand if anxiety strike go to the bathroom to remove yourself from the situation and breathe for a few minute it be hard I understand I work pa time and its a problem for I too deal with anxiety that work trigger   you must tell yourself that you know exactly what you do you be also a valuable employee   it be so difficult feeling with other in the workplace   keep to yourself stay focused and do your good and if you panic in front of other do not worry it will not be the end of the world everyone have anxiety at one time or another but it be hard hang in there think of the money and the bad anxiety of be unemployed repeat to yourself this feeling will pass and move on in the moment   xxxx
this be no way to live   your depressive disorder be a disease   just like have high blood pressure and refuse to take the medicine to control it   your medication do what your body be unable to do for itself

I do not know what the answer for you be at this point in your life but I know that med can help a lot with anxiety   the problem be we need a ceain amount of anxiety to spur we onwardbut too much anxiety can make your job a whole lot hard   that stress sure can wear you out   it can damage your body and mind   pray be what I do   I use to pray before work   I use to say to god I know that nothing be go to happen today that you and I can not handle together   some people will not believe this but god tell I to trust he   prayer help we with wisdom   we can ask for strength and for wisdom and power to get through the anxiety   I have a bible verse for you   timothy     wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of god which be in thee by the putting on of my hand   for god hath not give we the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind   the gift he speak of be prayer in the power of the holy spiritit be woh ask for   it be evidence that the holy spirit dwell in a believer in christ   it give power spiritually to live a christian life and to have faith   ask god for all these thing   go to a full gospel church   maybe you will not like I talk about faith but god can heal we if we trust he   it can take time   medication be something to pray about too   if you can attend a church or ministry where people pray for one another to get free of spiritual illness   once a woman pray for I when I be really depressed and god touch I and totally lift my depression and I have a great peace   some people have the gift of pray for people and the people get heal
I know I be on rispedidol for hallucination the come with the depression but I be not on anything for anxiety
resperidol be not an anxiety drug it be an antipsychotic generally use in bipolar schizophrenia etc
I be take rispedol and nothing for anxiety
and antidepressant help with anxiety   they take away my panic attack when I be young
mddmajor depressive disorder   and ironically depression and anxiety tend to go hand in hand
your anxiety be because you have put your body in danger never stop your med please rethink this choice
its safe to say you be not ok and you need to take your med anxiety will not just go away without the aid of medication
I absolutely understand where your come from your definitely not alone in this one there be very few people that I actually make call to regularly   it be because they be deal with similar issue to I so they understand I   I find they not only easy to talk to but they be a huge suppo we be suppoive to each other anyone else I speak to on the phone either call I or I be call they back they all understand this be how I be   how I need it to be I think the main reason I be not good at call people be the fact that it be exhaust   have to explain how I be what I have be up to if I can even remember what treatment I be currently have med etc if it be all work for I   what my doctor think or say sometimes they just want to know everything   it be tire also know that some of the people I be speak to do not really understand what I be deal with can be frustrating but still I have to remember that they be try they be make an effo they want to keep in contact because they be try to understand   they care I have to remember that it be a good thing   I do have to acknowledge respect   love they for that sometimes I do just text they a sho message though it be easy for I when I be not feel my good   I can control the detail that I want to go into they have learn to accept this about I   I guess any contact be well than no contact right in the end for I there be no right or wrong way when it come to contact my family member   friend I need to feel comfoable   somewhat understand by the people I be speak to   they need to understand that sometimes I do not want to talk about my issue I will just quickly let they know how I be do   that now I would rather talk about something else   our world do not have to constantly revolve around our illness especially when we be speak to family just because we feel it be expect sometimes it be nice to have a conversation that do not involve my illness I really hope that I have help you   not confuse you fuher
I be so sorry his be where I struggle too not the same situation per se but my hea break for you
stay strong folk and do not be afraid to get help its the label   mental illness that scare people   send out   care thought and love to any one that need it

not depakote but I have to stop take seroquel because of the restless legsdisturbed sleep I do stop the med after consult with my dr though always do that always consult your doctor
tell your doctor about the restless leg if the depakote be cause it they can find you another med rls by itself can make you feel suicidal let alone with a preexist situation   the affordable care act be still in place so if you do not have health insurance go to the emergency room   this be an emergency

ambien be a scary drug   I be on it for quite a while and the the same experience as many other do thing I do not remember the next day   I now take temazapam   it work fairly well but I be groggy for about half the next day   I only take it if I have not sleep for a few day   there be no easy answer to the sleep issue
I do not like   I only take at night around or   and I d still feel the affect the next day tell around   in the afternoon I have the weird dream on it also bad hot sweat feel like a zombie all day long then they give I something to take for mood stabilizer like wtf smhbeen on ever me for deppession   ocd anxiety there nothing I have not be on    I use to get kidney stone often also my gallbladder   liver do not function right I have the bad stomach pain every   I have be use medical marijuana now for about   yrs and juice fresh fruit   veggie and my life have be give back to I my body   mind feel heal and yes I still have depression but it be under control and now I be in control and never feel more well in my life herbalism really work for I
I discover remnant of food wrapperscontainer next to my bed and that be my cue that I be go downstairs to the kitchen   eat while asleep on ambien I be nervous of go down the stair when I be consciously awake so this really scare I so I stop use it for fear I might be one that would drive   not be aware I do feel rest after I awake though try take   belsomra and although I do not have same sideeffect it wire I up so bad my eye would not even stay close now I be back to take xanax mg when I can not sleep
I will not let anyone put I on ambien my mom be on ambien and she be a zombie she would   hallucinate thing and would do thing and have no memory of do it and she be completely addicted to it after watch her horror I be scared of that stuff
I have take for yrs yes if you take it and watch tv or read etc then you end up walk snack clean etc but in my case I have but   know what I be do at the time do find I have do nothing out of my character just more obsessed with eat or clean next morning I may have forget in morning but do remember with prodding   you must go to bed take it close your eye and go to sleep nothing else   my husband swear it will not work unless he take it   hour before uuuuggg   I have have to tell he go to bed he be eat a whole bag of popcycle in bed   or try and hold a conversation with other   so as it work for some with no side effect not so hot for other   we be all different chemically it will effect differently   unfounately I have al I need it to sleep and it work   but take it and immediately go to sleep   if you have trouble stop
I have be take ambien for a long time now so I guess I have work through a lot of the odd thing yes you will forget thing you do sometimes the stuff you do sholy before you take it too it give I the munchie too it be almost amusing when you find out what you eat last night suck when it hit hard and you have a glass of milk in your hand I never seem to forget that feel ever I do not sleep I do not get tired I be wide awake at am last night still and be back up at am I be not currently manic either this be I but without help with sleep I will not sleep at all and the mania come on to scary level
ambien save my life I be sleep maybe an hour a night and my health and mental health deteriorate drastically yes I finally go to sleep and I sleep for   hour straight but once I would be take it for about a month it   regulate and I be not sleep all the time or tired anymore   but these other lady be right sleep walk drive   eating and sex really do happen on it for I it be woh it I do not take it anymore and you can become dependant on it and that be not pretty for about a week after stop I have severe panic attack when I stop take it
I take ambien and would wake up and do thing I could not remember the next day it be really scary honestly I would take something different
ambien be the devil do stuff without remember horrible I will never take it again eventually I have to have my then   year old sta hide my key at night
when I be on it I feel the same way like a constant state of zombieness I end up get off of it because it make my anxiety bad but I take half of what he prescribe I it still help I fall asleep but I do not feel like the walk dead the next day
to help counter this problem my dr prescribe memory medication that be often use for mild alheimer can not spell that and dementia his reasoning be that some of my other med like mood stabilizer and anxiety med may also be pa of the memory problem
med can take normal emotion away   it be normal to have some mood   this be what I believe   we be all sinner and god send jesus to save we from our sin   if we walk with god he walk with we and he challenge we to become like he but he miraculously rescue we out of our sin by daily fill we with himself in the person of the holy spirit   when we repent of sin god hear we and help we    a christian live be all about relationship to god through christ a daily life of prayer and view our personal life through the what the bible say   we can change   some med make we less caring and compassionate   they can take our motivation away   our mental illness can make we irritable and uncare too   what I be do these day be pray to see people through gods eye   I know that god see we all through eye of love and understanding   he be for we   sometimes we just have to do the right thing and trust god to give we the strength and the love to go with it   god know the motivation of the hea   give thank for what you do right   feel good about every victory in become the person you want to become   our hea long for god and our hea long for true care relationship   it take effo these day to be a good neighbor   we all live more isolated life than people do one hundred year ago   it take effo to be outgoing and give   you can not do it all but we each can be give in some way   some people have all they can handle try to be good to their family

I be sorry to hear you feel this way   you know it be the illness make you feel this way there be a bit of sensibility and logic in what you have write so somewhere in the background you very much want to fight this I want to ask do you take any medication for your condition do you ever see a doctor   please do not think that people be wait for you to die they be not this be very much the illness and you have to be strong against it with the right medication you can have a normal life just as an example I have have mental health problem all my life and I have be on lithium duloxitane and amisulpride these drug of help I maintain a normal life and I have be in my job for   year I be diagnose with schizoaffective disorder and bipolar   year ago please do not give up hope please push the paranoid thought away and if you be not on med try and see a doctor your woh it you be in my thought     
you be love if no one else be go to say it I will I love you I love you for reach out I love you for share I love you for say something before you do something irreversible   the good metaphor I have ever hear be about a man have a conversation with god he do not want to go on he be tired he just want to find resthe could not make it another dayhe could not even make it until that nightand god ask can you make it to the kitchen eat breakfast then we will see how you feel do not think of handle the pain in day or even hourscan you make it a few more minuet yes you caneven if it be the most grueling and vulnerable momentsyou make it through this post you can make it through the commentsjust one more commentone more person tell you how love you be   you be love   you be impoant you be need   please stay
these feeling be symptom not truth and god be the one person who never have any bad feeling about you ever his approval of you do not have condition that be the kind of love you probly never experience either I do not know if you have a counselor but they do help they be the steady person when we be in chaos and they understand the struggle more than most people

that be what I be afraid of
I try therapy and my anxiety and depression spiral out of control and tell my psychiatrist and she do not offer a way to deal with it and I be in   out of the er from have panic attack even after take the med and the er   my pcp tell I my med need to be increase and she do not want to hear that either so what do I do
if you do not believe those average joe sit across from you will honestly help do not go   I try go to a therapist for depression anxiety and it do not last   visit   she try to prescribe I pill and baby talk that everything will be fine I be   not a child and she annoy I bad than my anxiety do   yeah I do not believe a stranger listening be a miracle fix
many of you seem to be struggle but be advise its a character test some pass some fallout but its very difficult to go it alone stick together united and your odd increase tenfold
hi there   sound as though thing have be dreadful for you of late    I guess to try to answer some of those question I would need to ask some of my own I be wonder first if you now live on your own   do you have people around to suppo you do you still have close family around and you talk about your mum originally do you have any professional suppo be you take any medication sorry for the question but I do not want to suggest anything which might offend or hu it probably will not help to read this but most of the feeling you describe sound very familiar and common with mental health problem these extreme feeling which of course be worrying and real    I be wonder if you have leave home and go away to study have your suppo network go if you be at college or university forgive I for the terminology as I be think you could be in the us and I be in the uk be there any suppo at your place of study we can be so unkind to ourselves when we be suffer   we can blame ourselves when it be all beyond our control    be there any wellbee course or workshop you can access   the road to recovery involve several thing which when you be in the midst of the turmoil can appear to be too much of a mountain to climb but it be possible and usually involve small but significant achievable step but we need to lean on people and we need people who can suppo we reach out to people on these site be a really good first step explain how you feel xx
sandra bowman benzos r indicate for the treatment of anxiety and no they will not kill you
I be skeptical that you be psychiatric provider will prescribe benzo for you if you have a history of abuse substance let I share my situation I also suffer from severe anxiety I have take xanax alprazolam in the past for a total of   year I staed see a new psychiatrist last year he treat patient with substance abuse disorder as a result he refuse to prescribe any benzo for I however they throw an ambien prescription   mg at I I may consider change physician
I need to go to beacon and pick up my result I do one too do not like the psych or the people in the office so I find another and never look back I be struggle with med now so I be go to need to get those
tell they your concern I have issue with opiate in the past and I tell they what I be worried about and what I be hope to accomplish with med great way to sta look for the right meds combo
alit of psychiatrist be try to ween people off the benzos one reason be because they have a street value but the big reason be because of the addiction I have be on klonopin for   yrs now and its getting to where they be not work like they use to because my body be use to they but even the with the problem I have my doc refuse to increase because they have a street value but after a whole year try to find something for my panicanxiety disorder and ptsd that have be the only thing that help and be the last medication I try even after refuse the xanax I have no idea what klonopin be back then what the doctor try you out on be what you need to try before the benzo because benzo can do permanent damage when come off of they just be honest about what be go on with you and discuss the medication they be offer
I have anxiety depression bipolar agoraphobia and panic attack I be on zoloft for my anxiety and depression which work good but keep I awake at night I take trileptal for bipolar and it work good and help I sleep I take ativan for panic attack and I only use it as need because it make you feel like a zombie
work with your doctor it have take I year to find the right one have someone you trust help you at your home life know what you be on and help you find the right you you want the wrong douse can mess you up and other can help you what work for other may not work for you you will still feel depression and anxiety and that be normal just do not let it completely control you that be why we all take our med good luck you be not alone in this battle
make sure to ask about side effect a lot of medication for mental illness because weight gain some even because depression and anxiety manic episode and suicidal thought so no these do not happen to everyone but it be good to know what may possibly happen a really bad one for weight gain be seroquel although it do help with sleep and mood apparently for many   and something that I have come across and it be something really horrible call akathesia and I hope I be explain this correctly not even sure I spell it correctly but it be a nerve disorder really the only way I can explain it be that it look like you be have a seizure your arm and leg move involuntarily it be a horrible horrible side effect of latuda which make I sad because latuda really work well for my bipolar depression but like I say not everyone get the side effect
I take gabapinten for anxiety work so much well than klonopin for I and I take a tricyclic for depression some uncomfoable side effect but I can not tolerate any other type of depression med
prudence lowe benjamin my doctor have I on all kind of medicine at one time but I have never hear of the benzo what be that for anxiety or for depression and why do you say it will kill you what be the side effect to it
clonazepam for panic attack effexorvenlafaxine for anxiety miazapine for insomnia
I have find ssris well for depression and anxiety snris tend to be good for depression but exacerbate anxiety and tend to be more addictive well that be my experience anyway redhea good of luck hope you feel well soon x
leave the med to the psych   just tell all of your concern of your illness anyone who walk in and sta ask for ceain med send an alarm off in the mind of your doctor   that be what be call drug seek behavior   the doctor be then more likely to reduce your med no matter how much you may need they   once that type of behavior be mark down in your chawell you see the problem
I second beth I would not go to the appointment ask for specific med I would talk to they about the symptom you be experience and how they be affect your life and ability to work and get along with family   benzo be a big deal they be incredibly addictive yes you feel well take they but you will need more and more to get the same effect and that lead to addiction please if the doctor decline to prescribe they do not feel they do not care about you they be express care not prescribe they   I love the effect of klonopin but have decide they be just too dangerous for I to be take as I abuse they I do not wish to take an overdose due to not be able to keep track of my dosage   I be on a non addictive medicine call buspar for anxiety so there be other option besides benzo
be careful ask for advice on med to take here everyone be different and what work for   will not necessarily work for you it be a trial and error thing and something you must work closely with your dr on it take I   mth to get the right combo I can say one thing drs be reluctant to pre robe benzodiazepine because they lose their effect if use long term so you need more and more and they be addictive great for sho term use but that be about it talk to your dr about cognitive behavioural therapy    it have be great for I as it have give I tool to help myself I have bipolar i and anxiety disorder
I too I be on medication and in therapy to help manage my anxiety and major depression
sometimes depression cause anxiety so maybe stae on an antidepressant would be well just tell they all your symptom your feeling your question and your concern tell they what your treatment goal be too
I have look into both tms   ect I have be tell that tms help more with anxiety   depression but not other illness like bipolar
you cut because you be nervous and it relieve anxiety   if you figure out what time you do it and what be go through your head when you do it that will help   it give you some kind of satisfaction   if you can find something else to do with your mind and your body at that time that be positive it might help   can you draw crochet or knit when you be feel anxious like this   if these thing make you more nervous do not do they so long
try not to think about it that way bro think about the positive I personally deal with the same kind of stuff I scare myself thought of suicide every single minute of everyday but I just try as much as I can to distract myself and if I can not then I will admit I take it out on myself   self harm   but its well than the alternative I be here for you if you ever want to just chat
it sound so dreadfully hard for you at this time   it also sound as though you ve be go through this turmoil for such a long time   I wish I have all the answer I be wonder how long you have be see your therapist and if you feel see they be help you also state you be take medication but still feel as bad as this   have you be take they for a long time and do your therapist feel they be the right tablet and the right dose as you be still struggle so much the only thing with try to help and to feed back be the need to ask fuher question only just to try to think of thing which might help you talk about the feeling you have to your wife   I be wonder how long you have be together how suppoive she be and I guess deep down how you feel about your relationship can you remember the feeling you have when you first get together what attract you can you recall some of those happy memory that be a difficult one only you can really come to the conclusion how you really feel do you have any meaningful activity in your life you do not say whether you be able to work with regard to consider why you cut yourself it be hard to say as luckily I have never do that not that I do not consider do something and it be probably hard to remember the exact thought before and while you be do it   I remember the thought when I consider it people have suggest probably already the main reason people do it such as actually want to feel something as depression often make you literally feel numb while at the same time your head can be in such a turmoil I be wonder too if it can be the culmination of pen up anger resentment and frustration when you can not escape the desperate situation you be in   when there seem nothing you can do to escape other than if you be lucky sleep sometimes could this be a way of interrupt the cycle of over think and feel dreadful often I know I want to escape   I be not live merely exist   whilst battle depression and anxiety day after day the desire to be somewhere else be immense but it always seem so illusive   when we crave contentment and peace the happy life so many seem to have then occasionally death might seep into our thought as a well alternative to the sht we be always feel I know luckily that be not the answer and also I do not want to not be here I just do not want to be there I guess what I be try to say be we so desperately want all this pain to end and sometimes end it all seem to only solution of course it be not there be a well way recovery and a well life be the way the key but to reach that can seem such a monumental task to get there unfounately can take a long time but it be possible and real but you do need people to help it be necessary to lean on people and to let they help   recovery rely on many thing some very small but all impoant be there any other agency you can access charity peer suppo exercise be really good but small achievable and significant step be key goal be helpful not huge goal small one little step exercise can literally begin with just sit in the sun feel the sun on your face try once again to feel the sensation of the weather around you build up to perhaps a sho walk and build up from there of course I do not want to patronise and teach you to suck egg as they say over here but just try to remember the thing which help I on the road to well mental health go back to the self harm I be wonder sometimes it might also be want to actually feel something   the illness and the drug can leave you feel nothing and inflict pain on yourself will make you feel it might also dive your thought from the pain you feel inside your head to the actual physical pain it be so hard to put into word what I think when I consider it I feel as though I want to punish myself in some way that be payback for not be able to beat this hideous illness   I think I feel a failure and weak in some way that the depression be win and I be not strong enough to control it it be control I and why be not I able to fight this off and get well also I hate be so self centre   with depression I feel I spend all my day go over and over the past relive awful thing that have happen and just wallow in self pity   I hate it that be not I I be not selfish but I could not stop it be self hard a way of hue myself do I deserve to be punish of course I do not but I could not see it at the time   we can be so hard on ourselves    mental illness be so hard when we have such conflicting emotion and have the strength to recover just allude we when we need it most so sorry to run on so just try to really think if there be anything which you might be able to relate to a healthy diet and try to introduce thing to give your life meaning be very impoant   I know it can be hard when sometimes it be not even possible to get out of bed but you have do so well in admit thing and getting help   the desire to get well be the key    there be a well way recovery and inner peace be possible but it take time we must try so hard for ourselves we owe it to ourselves to beat this and to our love one well wish always here x
I be a recover self harmer one of the thing that help I be when I want to cut I would squeeze ice cube this sound stupid but wait squeeze release that stress and there be a bit of pain that come from the coldness of the ice it have be a long hard road this do not always work but sometimes it do I hope this help someone
I be sorry you be go through that I myself be go through the same thing I have be off and on medication for year now I have also be place in hospital our story be pretty similar sometimes we do not realize what we do because we have panic attack we feel a loss of hope that no one care and you feel like you want to give up on life that be how I feel and sometimes I feel that way often still so I hope you get treatment and hope everything go well with you
I know it cost money any go against many belief but get tattoo be well than cut my bf be   against tattoo so I have not get one yet and it be embarrass my scar from the pasti use to cut as it would drown out the pain iiwas feel at the time

the lamictal rash can progress to stevensjohnson syndrome which be lifethreatene so you do the right thing stop the med but you still should have see a doctor at the onset of the rash notify your prescriber as soon as possible and get to the first md you can see   urgent care or er or whatever blisteringpeele skin can be a sign of sjs do youdo you have flulike symptom too
you be suppose to sta on the low dose and slowly sta to go up to avoid the rain it be a symptom that make you basically allergic to your own skin your doctor should have inform you of this and tell you to send he a picture of the rain immediately when it appear to determine if it be from the medication you do the right thing to stop it if you stop it soon enough it should subside
go to your dr as soon as possible and let they know about it not try to scare you but the rash can cause death

I have not sleep in three day I feel terrible sometimes I can not feel anything I get numb without emotion other time I be sad and irritable my paner do not seem to understand or I do not know what I can say because we no long communicate like we use to I feel like when I open up he feel tired of it or he feel helpless I do not know but I be not feel normal most of the time it be exhaust       
believe I I know what you mean my parent know I have anxiety   I do stress out over bill but they do not no what I go through they tell I to not stress   that I be okay I normally have my fiance who talk to I who let we I no he be there to suppo I   that everything be go to be okay   I mean I really do not no what else to do people do not understand
it be mostly difficult when there be no suppo people will just tell you to stop stress and pray but when you can not control how you feel how do you get through the day it be really misunderstood
I wait until I be almost   to finally try anxiety medication   I really wish I have try soon you might want to consider it especially in combination with therapy that be what have help I so immensely

brenda anxiety be real and you be an insensitive fool
cassondra pettit I would not just write my story about anxiety if I do not mean it I have suffer anxiety   depression along time   sometimes I think people do not understand how it can make the person feel   I post on here to let people know about my anxiety and depression because its sometimes hard to find anyone who understand I and how anxiety take over I sometimes I can not control it at all   I pray a lot that one day I will over become the anxiety its not a   easy thing to deal with in life
aww I think that be really not nice to say this person be obviously struggle and look for some help bash they down due to be a ceain site be not very nice and will not help this person in any way what so ever even if it be just a bipolar site anxiety still come with bipolar and would think that anyone who have suffer this would understand this person emotional state people go through this should suppo each other not bash they down it do not hu to show a little sympathy and suppo know how it feel xxx
I just want to get my story out there I feel alone at time I get anxiety   depression I do take medicine for they but it do not always help
if you have a close friend or family member you trust go and talk to they   work keep busy help I some when I sta think too much about the negative go for a walk painting pray   do something that will make you happy   sometimes I be afraid to go place to and end up drive around because I do not want to be inside a building   sometimes I will force myself to step out because I can take medication and go to counseling but the only person that go to help I be myself and god   keep push through it spread love to you  
yes I agree that it be about suppo for everyone involve I too have multiple diagnosis depression anxiety bipolar and borderline personality disorder I be in multiple suppo group   mental illness and a lot of time I see people who post do not have much suppo from the people they know personally such as myself and this way it be like a third person and if we do not judge each other we be able to give idea to help one another I can see how have thing group together can be somewhat confusing but it work for a lot of people
terri di mauro to the good of my professional knowledge an right now with   year of clinical experience I do not dispute your opinion however I believe that anxiety be include as a diagnostic criterion for bipolar disorder I believe that alot of member of these suppo community tend to fixate on their multiple diagnosesi have bipolar gad ptsd borderline personality disorder etc mania and depression must coexist in order for the bipolar diagnostic criterion to be satisfied I do not mean to come across but I just want to convey the downside of group multiple diagnosis together may cause some confusion among it be member especially since it be an open group in contrast the bipolar suppo group be closed
some manifestation of bipolar mania include high anxiety so the   can be very closely related it be also often the case that those diagnose with bipolar end up with a dual diagnosis include anxiety andor depression

you have to allow yourself to grieve but keep take care of yourself talk about it here or in any place you feel safe to be a good sta I get a dog a few year ago and she change my life for the well in more way than I can describe you be sad and that be okay trust yourself to find another passion to get motivated about maybe read to people in the hospital or nursing home or perhaps just drop in to visit everybody need encouragement and to know that someone care that go for you as well do not be afraid to ask for what you need people that love you want to help but usually do not know how
hi there so sorry to hear thing be so difficult   phew you have a lot go on no wonder you might be struggle   forgive I but I be unceain if you be in the youk or we so not sure as to the suppo which be available to you firstly a little around bereavement loss and grief   when someone have be a carer for any length of time if the person they be care for die this can leave a huge void for the bereaved   not only can you grieve for they deeply regardless of the relationship but your whole purpose and role have disappear overnight   you provide such a valuable and wohwhile lifeline and service which you know help so much so when that be all go it be perfectly feasible that you will literally feel redundant personal loss in any form can leave the bereaved feeling lose alone or abandon   care for someone as much as you do can    also mean the person leave behind be just no long need deal with grief for anyone can be so hard let along someone who may have other difficulty such as mental health problem the impact can be far more severe death be very hard to comprehend sometimes   how can someone be there so close one day and so far away the next we need logic in our life to understand and make any sense death rob we of that recovery from the loss of a love one and come to term with the grief be usually most effective if we can learn to manage the grief find a way forward to build a new life with new purpose where you can feel need once again and but hold onto those precious memory of our love one I have notice many other have suggest good possible way of move forward a new interest put your wonderful talent and quality to a good and valuable use and to help you feel value again so you can hopefully begin to feel as though you be provide a wohwhile service to someone or something in the case of a pet or animal charity there be so many deserving cause which I be sure would love to have someone such as yourself volunteer when I be at an all time low my goal eventually be to do some wohwhile voluntary work get a meaningful job and to do a course to learn something new as well as several other thing which would help such as exercise a healthy diet and sunlight etc   none of these thing happen overnight and to I it be small but significant step towards an eventual goal it be not easy of course I will not pretend it be but it be possible but you also need to lean on those who care and engage with outside help too if it be available ie professional and charity sorry to run on not try to preach just think of anything which might just help good wish xx
I be so sorry for your loss I lose my mother april   of   it send I into a tailspin after the reality set in I be manic for over a year from that I suggest take action now before anything get bad be proactive   the outcome be never good from a manic episode and add the anxiety on top of that it be just horrible my love go out to you and I hope you find peace redhea

I be find these post really annoying I be bipolar with depression and anxiety I work my ass off to be the good I can be rather that than spout how I be up then down and get scared bla bla bla I be bipolar and proud that every day I do my very good to be amazing rant over
forgive I as I be not aware of this schoeffective disorder and could not find anything online so I will just consider the anxiety as that be something I have more experience of   as a mother of a teenage son with acute anxiety it can be so so hard   as a parent we want to fix thing make everything ok and if we can not we can feel so helpless it be such an awful feeling to see your son suffer so much   acute anxiety can be so crippling many people just do not realise some even completely do not understand or wrongly assume we just want to make everything ok and when we can not we can feel a failure at time when sometimes there just be not anything we can do to make thing ok with my son one of the main thing he need and rely upon be my strength resilience understanding and know I be always there for he through thick and thin   if I be to falter or push he into something he be not happy with then I know he could not have cope   I believe they need love one to understand and be there for they   it be hard enough to deal with the problem it make everything so much bad when they believe people do not understand one of most frustrating thing I have find about mental illness be the slow rate of recovery and be able to move forward   it can take so long to build up the confidence need to be able to do thing   when we crave the day when our child and young people can essentially be able to live a normal life it can be heabreake to see they struggle with a half life battle with their demon on a daily basis when we see other their peer live happy fruitful and care free life it be so hard to know   what our young people be go through especially when we see their youth disappear not be able to fulfill their potential not be happy sometimes it be just too painful to really contemplate and it be well for our own sanity to just focus on the here and now and try to put our energy into the daily challenge because progress can seem so painfully slow eg get a job learn to drive it be impoant to try to focus on small step small goal by gentle encouragement and with kind praise and empathic reinforcement   it have to be more their pace than ours as frustrating as it often be quite often unfounately the pressure this bring on we have adverse effect and can lead to mental health problem for the parent who bare the lion share of the stress   we be not always strong enough which make thing extra hard do you have any other professional suppo for you or your son it can feel so isolate when you see other effectively lead normal life thing can get well it be find that way forward to beat the condition so they can control it rather than it control they this can come with maturity and use each productive experience as evidence that they have overcome their anxiety on a paicular day or in a specific activity I be sure you be do a wonderful job and together as a team thing will get well but unfounately it can take a lot of time care and patience well wish x
marilyn corrado ah yes I can see the symptom now apology for that   I guess too you be in the us and I be in the uk so unfounately service and provision be different there it sound to I you be a brilliantly suppoive and insightful mum   I be sure your son know how lucky he be to have your continue suppo   I know with mine he rely so heavily on I which as you describe can feel as though you be do everything in your power for he but on the flip side it can feel such a weight a pressure to make everything ok    it can seem as though you have to fight so hard for everything   to get he into the good school for his need do not sound easy but you do it and it probably good for he in many way but clearly he be struggle with the whole idea of be around like minded people that be one of the most difficult area   I really struggle with the whole issue of how to sell the idea of have a mental illness to my son   his problem stae at the age of ten and I do not want to label he I do not want he to be define by it to think that this be how it be always go to be   like you I want it to be talk about no secret or white lie as such but I also want to give he hope that it would not be like this forever even though of course I have no proof of that   it be all so difficult and sometimes as parent we have to make these constant difficult decision   we have no handbook how do we know what to do and say for the good all we can do be try our good for he to not want to engage or socialise with the other do sound understandable   he want to feel normal he want to be a normal teenager   in a way I do not really want to take he to workshop or course for mental illness as it seem to I that I would be confirm that this be to be his life   it be a really hard thing to know what be for the good sometimes but sometimes it be only those who suffer who truly understand it be get to be the right person I suppose for he to relate to and to feel an affinity with it be not easy yes peer suppo and meet other in similar situation can really help sometimes be there any charity which have meeting although of course these might not be able to access if your son feel paicularly anxious do he engage with understand people through social medium would you know this seem to be the most common mean nowadays it must be difficult for you when you have other child as well   do you have avenue to be able to do thing for you and people to suppo you unfounately as frustrating it be we can not just fix they   my son who be also   have have very bad long period of suffer anxiety but he be slowly move forward have recently secure a job and be stae to build a well life   he be far from cured of course and live quite an insular life but there be hope and I be sure you will get there but depression as a result of acute anxiety be a real possibility and a challenge to ideally avoid or if not treat   xx
thank you his school have his psych and therapist which he see x a week and then when need I go x a week or more if need I want to just fix he I be his good friend and that break my hea we do everything together which in turn can be try on my patience I then have to take some time alone and regroup I have other boy so they all need something the process be so very slow for recovery but he have improve beyond word over the past year so I have to focus on that I just see that he gettte depressed since he s almost   and just not able to do what the other be do you write a beautiful response and I appreciate that I wish there be group for parent like aa meeting so we can meet other seem many parent be reserve about their child with illness we be open about it as I feel this be nothing to be ashamed of   I fight for year to finally get he into the school he be in and its be the good thing for he the problem with the school be that he will not let himself connect with any of the kid there as he say they be all weird but they be all like my son some bad some not but he can not accept the he have a disability and keep fight it I be hope once he accept it and just know that the anxiety be his norm for now he may enjoy life a little more

bipolardepressionanxiety open page never assume it be only one person that be damage
do it be scary
I m there now but staing fresh be go to be the hard pa for I my fianc leave I on friday we be together for   year can not get she out of my head my ptsd bi polar anxiety n depression be very high right now do not know what to do
hope you do not really feel that way   I have be depress and have extreme anxiety my whole life and I know god put I here for a reason I have great memory and future plan please get help you do not have to feel that way
I have very similar symptom to yours and be also not sure if I be bipolar   my son be diagnose but a psychiatrist tell I I be a borderline case I be just utterly confused because the low be so bad I just want die and then it get well again till the next time I be not on any med at the moment have be on so many different med over the year and can not really say they make much difference
I too be diagnose with bp I be currently take medication it be constantly an on and off cycle for I I have also notice if I track my nutrient such as b vitamin folate and magnesium specifically in my diet I can maintain a more stable mood it be hard because for   year I have try to figure out pattern   nowadays I know if I wake up with a bunch of energy and I sta organize or clean or try to do everything at once I know I be in a manic moment it be an every day struggle but for I track my mood and what nutrient I be in take have really help I use cronometer for nutrient tracking n i journal for mood pattern information and structured routine be key for I also it be very difficult to meditate but I try to because that also put I in a much well mood afterwards
bp can have a depressedmanic ratio of   which mean you will experience chronic depression with bout of hypomania so it sound like that may be what you be experience remember manic be not always happy and feel great it can also be just irrational and irratable behavior really anything where you have pen up energy that do not go away period of pen up energy that manifest in negative emotion and action be probably a mixed state which be when you have to be very mindful and aware as they can be the most dangerous pa of live with bipolar I would journal as much as you can detail about how you feel when you feel that way thing you do how you act trigger that send you into depressed state or irritable or manic etc this can really help a psychiatrist see a pattern that make it easy to diagnose whatever be go on
it take a year of my psych work with I for they to finally say bp even with my history past hospitalization etc she stae medicate and witness I in one mixed state and then head into one hypomanic episode before finally shift from major depressive disorder anxiety and ptsd to the bipolar it definitely could be bipolar from what you be describe just please be prepare for they to be cautious in make the diagnosis it take time I be glad you be take step and wish you well
that sound like a mixed state my friend common with bp listen to your dr and to your own sense of wellbee ask question be inform and do not be afraid to ask for suppo when you need it
I have discover that industrial rock be a good remedy for depression and anxiety

have have so many med I have lose count each one have their own side effect over the the las ten year after a psychotic episode and be diagnose bipolar anti depressant make I high as a kite but it only take psychiatrist   year to come to that conclusion now I be now on med that keep I on the low side of steady they keep I out of hospital but I be so depressedanxiety that I hate wake up in the morning frightened of what mood I will be in and how I be go to cope most way also have lose all friend as I have not be fit to work for   year I can understand they need to move on but why can not they give I the odd phone call I be a decent person and know I could never do that to they also be in and out of hospital you meet people think they be friend and we swap phone number but if you be kind heae you soon realise they only want you for what you can give they   so I now realise they be not any good for I I have not be in hospital for   year and although I be low I pray I do not want to go back again just wonder if anyone else have have a similar experience and can not see your way out of it xx

I pretty sure you need a moid stabilizer w bipolar   none of those be mood stabilizer anxiety will be low w mood stabilizer prob will not need ativan and be you be dr use gabapentin for anxiety may not need that if dr order you a mood stabilizer
I be on gabapentin side effect be so bad I would shake so bad and be up   time a night weeing I be on cymbalta now it be pretty good
every one have different reaction and body chemistry I be not sure what you be ask   I take a mood stabilizer antidepressant and an anti anxiety I can not take benzodiazepine because of my addictive behavior if what your taking work then stay with it if you be concerned or feel you need something different ask your doctor if you be not see a psychiatrist it would help you to do so always give your med time but also do not rely on other opinion   yours and your psychiatrist be what matter good luck
zoloft gabapentin and xanax   ptsd and bipolar   gabapentin make I forgetful so they put I on lamictal but if I have not be so air head I would have stay on it since for I the combo be amazing for the anxiety and mood swing

I have type   with anxiety and be on xanax aswell I be on valluim but go down hill quick a doc that specialist in this tell I that the valluim run off the same receptor in the brain as the bipolar disorder medication hence go down hill but I find this work for I but each person be different hope this help
I be a little concerned about your dose of lamotrigine the max daily dose should only be   mg anything above that be not any more effective and may lead to a great risk of develop adverse event
bipolar   generalized anxiety and ptsd here I take trileptal   mg daily    mg pill   morning and   at night   mg bupropion xr in the morning and   mg of trazadone and mg of seroquel with trileptal at night I also have valium to take as need for severe anxiety attack
lamitcal abilify hydroxyzine propanalol for anxiety mdd and bipolar ii
I on celexa ampilfy xanax and gabapentin but I do take other med for diabetes and other ailment I be bipolar with severe depression and anxiety
if that be the combination that work ok but injectible abilify you can take that orally it be a horrible drug I personally have bad reaction to it at the forefront be akathisia lamotrigine do not do anything for I clonazepam help anxiety for awhile but stop work so do xanax   I have be diagnose with bipolar disorder generalize anxiety disorder and panic disorder the combination that end up work for I be   mg lithium carbonate er and   mg seraline for some reason yes my body need an ssri   everyone be biochemistry be different unfounately it take play the medication game a few time before find the right combination of medication   this really do seem like overkill but I be not the doc either also it really depend on if you be function and happy if you be you be in the right place for now
seraline mg deppression n anxiety
bipolar   and anxiety   mg lemetrogen mg saphris mg temazepam
bipolar ll adhd ptsd    guess I be lucky    mg zoloft   mg strattera and   mg xanax for panic attack

yes it be an antipsychotic it make I depressed then they put I on a mood stabilizer to balance it out and it work but still need my clonazepam for anxiety
I take mg lithium mg latuda mg zyprexa mg seroquel mg lexapro and mg pristiq three time a day diagnose with bipolar   and paranoidtype schizophrenia I be struggle   
woah you do not need to be on   antipsychotic latuda zyprexa seroquel and an ssri lexapro and an snri pristiq also pristiq be definitely not dose   time a day I be sorry but as a pharmacist I need to let you know that this drug regime be a recipe for disaster there be no additional benefit with dose great than   mg of pristiq same with great than   mg of lexapro anything great than that put you at risk of dangerous hea arrhythmia how long have you be take this regime do your doctor educate you on the sign and symptom of serotonin syndrome no wonder you be strugglingi be so sorry     I suggest you see another psychiatrist      femalesign I know that this be all unsolicited but as a healthcare professional I could not help it
suez goturback fleshman I also use cannabis alot personally it stae when I be very alone and depress as a way to help I cope but even now that I be much much more happy and healthy it still be a great mood stabilizer and also help I manage my sleep schedule   a lot well get a solid   hour of sleep every night be one of the most impoant factor to remain mentally healthy I try to sleep without it but if my mind be race I know it will level I out and help I go to sleep and I do not have to worry about insomnia become a problem that compound on my other symptom but with all of this being say everyone be different everyone react to different medication differently but cognitive behavior therapy be the one thing that I have experience be a one size fit all type of treatment that work very well
if the combo have relieve you of symptom do not rock the boat klonopin stay around for some time in your system and can usually get away with take less than perscribed give you be take a small dose but a through out the day   mg which be about a normal   michele I be not a doctor but I have study pharmacology to its basic give adderall with klonopin that mighy not be a good idea plus add into gabapentin ouch doxepin as well   see if your doctor can minimize this combo over time your brain and body be not go to like be up and down like that adderall be ceainly something you may do with out as it cause anxiety   and can agitate insomnia panic attack and a schizoaffective disorder
ebbie casey my daughter get so trigger when she go out   her thinking about other get so mixed up   she imagine people be look at she talk about her etc   she imagine that people be other people or that she see people from her past   the stress of go out alone really trigger she   she can not be on more med   do anyone have a strategy for get more comfoable with go out on your own to diminish these reaction
an take some rispiridone and it knock that everyone be watch I edge off I be schizo affective adhd bipolar I have have   serious nervous break down I take adderal no it be probably not the good idea   elvis but as doctor say and I agree   it help my patient focus and finish project or chore it help he live a somewhat normal life with out this medicine my life become a mess the house turn into a maze of unfinished cleaning and project my brain think to fast and I sometimes struggle to keep up with myself the adderal lift I up a bit yes not that much it then help I to slow down and think thing out to properly finish everything I sta and I do not fidget and squirm you be right probably not the good combo for everyone but I simply take rispiridone to knock off that nasty edge
I be guinea pig with vistaril and it have no reaction with I prob ably because it be original intend use be for blood pressure I get so tired of be put on med that have other intend use and treat anxiety be just a possible side effect
I be on prozac abilify adderall klonopin doxepin and gabapentin but I be diagnose with schizoaffective bipolar disorder ptsd add ocd generalize anxiety disorder bereavement insomnia panic disorder with social anxiety and agoraphobia
the ability to sleep regularly have a good   appetite but not overeat be able to take care of ourselves and not take unnecessary risk have a manageable anxiety level have the ability to think and be organize be motivate to get out of bed in the morning not be too irritable be able to listen to people without interrupt be able to express ourselves well be able to work towards some satisfaction in life be able to have some self woh some peace of mind and good solid relationship be all thing we want to have in our life if our mood or our mixed up thinking be interfere with these thing then we need the med
thank     it be not always easy but I have to push through can not let my kid see I struggle on my bad day I sometimes have to go in bathroom   and splash water to cover the fact I be cry but my kid     keep I go along with my therapy cat
I use seroquel for bipolar one and anxiety it be s great feud but careful with you be weight  
as far as I since it be completely different for everyone I have be on   mgs of seroquel when I be really bad in highschool for   month and function great I mean it put I out immediately so I only take it at night but the next day I be as normal as possible it make I gain weight quickly currently I be only on   of seroquel and only take more if it be an emergency and I just need to sleep through it   cymbalta I be on it for around   year until it become useless to I after brain chemistry change it help keep I stable and be good for my depression I assume it help with my overall anxiety and ocd not sure though
lot of ugly on seroquel lol it be highly effective at treat anxietypsych issue if you do not mind eat the house down make you starve and lot of people gain serious weight myself
no real issue with low dose seroquel yet just make sure you have   hour to sleep after take it otherwise you might be a zombie the next day cymbalta   believe your doc when they say do not stop take it without consult the doc the withdrawal symptom range from annoying to potentially lifethreatening
do not know about cymbalta but seroquel have change my life I love it take my psychosis symptom to very manageable hardly any paranoia sleep amazing and anger problem soe right out it be not ideal during day cos it do knock you out so need to slightly cut dose but woh it for the benefit also I do gain nearly   stone but have manage to lose it and maintain the loss
put on like kgs with seroquel in like   week so come of that cymbal be great to sta with but anxiety level be high and it stop work after about mth
think of reduce my dose actually have ceainly curb my anxiety
seroquel knock I out my maintenance guy come by to fix the sink I try to get up but could not move my body be asleep but I could hear he talk weight gain as well I have be on cymbalta for yrs and help with my depression I be back on ativan for anxiety though I be feel much well now
withdraw from cymbaltaba be horrid I have to go into the hospital for week until physical symptom be relieve a bit but it take month before mental symptom staed to clear   I would much rather have withdraw from an opiate
seroquel keep I very stable however I be in too deep of sleep and be afraid I would not wake up so I just have my dose lower
cymbalta be the o ly anti depressant that work for I   it do not help with anxiety they try I on mg and it make I sick and it do not help with pain   medication react differently for different people though I take myself off the cymbalta and I be take mg of abilify they be work but my bf say pill poison you blah blah so all I take now be valium and if I take trazadone sometimes it knock I out for a whole day and I can not have that I think it be similar to serequel I be mg   as need though
be on cymbalta for year and it help with my anxiety without it my head would be spin the bad at least for I when it get close to the time of my dose I experience anxiety chest tightening and all so just make sure you do not miss dose
I have bipolar   and I be put on   mg of lithium and   mg of risperidone I recently get that decrease to   mg though I have not be manic be over a year and I feel mostly good my dad pass away from lung cancer last august and I be struggle to find a job so I be depressed and anxious about that but that be understandable
I take lamictal   and when they take I off tegretol they double the lamictal dose and tolld it would hold I do not happen have a horrible long mania so they end up put I back on tegretol and keep the lamictal as well for I lamictal just be not enough   if you be have mania then you need more of a mood stabilizer plus a new doctor if shehe will not listen to you   no doc should be threaten when we do research into our condition we be the one live with it not they   I have be diagnose bipolar   for   year or so
they use drug like limictil and tegratol which be anti seizure med but for mood stabilizer they slow down the brain enough it stabilize mood so it do not matter if you have one or two I be on tegratol and it have save my life nothing else have ever work so well if you be do well I would not worry about it
I be bi polar ocd add autism anxiety over
if it be work x do not worry they only say that because it seem to help more with the depression side of thing which bipolar   peep seem to suffer more from I be bp and just try it last reso get desperate and I have a life threaten reaction to it so count yourself lucky you have find something that work I have be battle rapid cycling and major depression look for the right med for   year now but I be overly sensitive to everything the only thing save I at the moment be valium and lot of it trust I if it work do not worry what it be mean for which be actually epilepsy by the way   
lamictal make I barf it be not woh it then they try many othersprozac in am zyprexa in pm I be not happy to repo that the side effect lamictal make I so sick in   day all the other I have take over   year be never woh I   just treat my anxiety with xanax   small dosage and hydroxizine    visteral which help with anxiety
I have bipolar   I be also on lamictal I take it with my lithium I would think that as long as the medication be work and it be treat the bipolar I would try not to stress too much about if it be for bp one or two
lamictol be a great mood stabilizer why he go off cymbalta he must be very careful as withdrawal from it be frightening
I have always take my lamictal in one dose ask my dr if I could she look up the half life   tell I I could its more convenient   I do not miss dose some drs tell I it need to be in   dose yet I have never have any of they look up the half life I continue to take it in one dose but I tell the dr whatever they want to hear   lamictal be a mood stabilizer abilify be an antipsychotic medication lexapro zoloft etc be antidepressant drug be careful not to compare these drug to one another it would be like compare apple to orange lastlycheryl berndt you be confused genetic disorder like bipolar depression gad adhd be treatable with medication thing like ptsd narcissistic personality disorder   stockholm syndrome etc be also mental illness yet these be some type of mental illness that medication do little for they be not a chemical imbalance
latuda work wonder for I and xanax for anxiety
the gene for my anxiety be slca accord to bipolar writer and psychiatrist k r jamison the identification of a gene for bipolar be definitive
if his condition be genetically inherit he be actually his real self in which case no intake of any form of medication will alleviate any of the symptom associate with the illness moreover uninhabited illness exacerbate the inherit one which be marginally aid by medication   my inherited illness be generalize anxiety disorder and bipolar   disorder exacerbate by acquire borderline personality disorder    rapid cycling mood ptsd and ocd the powerful medication I be on set I off into a middleoftheroad dimension as I remain marginally well
hi I be on it for anxiety and depression and it be a good medication just it can have extreme side effect that you should familiar yourself with if your paner break out into a rash call your doctor immediately
be on it almost   month have have a slow steady increase of dozage over quite a period of time do not know yet if it will work for I over a long period of time sideeffect hmm for the last   week I have have very bad anxiety   a type I have never experience before it be be so bad that it be lead I to develop pattern of ocdlike thinking and action this anxiety make I exhaust also more irritated borderline aggressive mention this new to my caregiver since   I myself think this anxiety level and mood may be sideeffect of lamictal however psychiatrist do not think so do not know if other have experience similarby the way be swedish and over here the drug often be call lamotrigin
only thing that keep I go be earn a bit more money and often main reason I do not commit suicide be because I do not want my sibling to inherit my share of the family foune how sad be that I can not tolerate anyone opinion I can not get on with friend I take everything seriously I do not go to meeting because I get really stress out with people there I be an aist apparently very good accord to a well establish a expe and aist who love my painting   but I can not stand work with anyone especially other student I be at college I fall out with just about everyone then want to be alone I be huge misfit   I have gender reassignment nearly   year ago but now feel really depressed about what I do my love life be pretty good I have a lover who look after I and I be fairly well off plenty spare cash because I be always sell thing I do not get on with my father who do not understand I or my kid I live on my own with my cat ironically I get really lonely but I can not stand company   yes I do get diagnose with aspergersadhd   year agoi come of anti depressant in feb and feel well in some way but I think about kill myself every day even though I be well off than lot of people have a lot of freedom have two car nice house nice cat   only thing I be really good at be a and I hate everyone else in the a world there so full of crap for a woman I be strange as I be obsess with motor car I staed drink again after be of alcohol for ten year but do not feel right drinking now as a female as I do when male I hate be transgend very few seem to understand my life be in a relative state of calm yet I want to end it maybe I be fuel by disaster and prefer disaster
I totally agree with the first comment I too have a great life a truly amazing wife a brilliant although admittedly sometimes stressful job great friend about to move to a lovely new house and the future be look great however I still want to pick up the courage to jump off the near bridge I have the urge but thankfully be resist the urge to self harm every day it be not circumstance it be the brain do stupid thing keep your head up we be all here for you x
depression be not situational dependent   depression be a mental illness that can hit anyone at any age at any time there can be ceain personality trait that be more susceptible or often connect to depression   however this do not mean that those without these indicator be not at risk for this illness
I take it along with anti depression and anxiety med I be stable and with blood work   time a year healthy
I thonk and eham bamm that be I be good bad ugly or indifferently numb or anxious or joyful
sometimes when I get nervous or anxious I get paranoid
oh my I be go through the same exact thing   I be worried I will not be able to hold down this job long enoughwhat happen when I go through something else and I can not get my disability back   I be also a good fighter but sometimes I just want to stay home and think all day about everything I mean everything then I get paranoid and depressed I be a wreck but I need the money
I have not work since I be diagnose   year ago   I do sta volunteer at a local aquarium one day a week   it be a stretch physically but mentally and emotionally too   be around crowd interact with stranger no downtime   some day I have to retreat to the stairwell just to clear my head   it get easy each time   just factor in the physical stress of do something new and know that will effect you emotionally as well
since you seem to be unceain have you think about take a baby step like maybe school first then work or maybe like a babysitting job or a hobby you can take up to occupy your time I would hate for you to go all the way in if you be not completely ready cuz it would make you feel even bad be there
yep no interest in anything I work third shift be almost always sit around by myself lonely as fuck but anxious when I be around people have nothing to say bday   be come up and I see nothing but a steady decline nothing to look forward to no hope kill time while it be kill I watch life go by
I be take it now for about month and still have not be affectively do anything doctor keep try everything with itmy body fight itnow with latunda let we seeall I want be to get some sleepi only get   hrs a day and feel horribleany suggestion
it make you feel out of control when not in it your mad sad you want to cry at everything you can not sleep you fall off it awful I have be in it   year now my insurance say they no long pay for it I do not know what I be go to do I am so scared I will get so sick plus I be a ex drug addict I be scared I will use to ease my pain so what ever you do try and keep your head up
it be horrible for I I go off slowly and accord to the doctor order still withdrawal suck
horrible be zombie   sleep   hrs a night
I be on a low dose of seroquel to help I sleep and help my mood it do the trick except for   side effect I have the most terrifying nightmare in my life I would wake up feel so anxious it be not woh the stress cut cold turkey with no symptom   but again it be a low dose I try trazadone after that and have hangover symptom nausea   vomiting   migraine now I be on invega I do not snap as much or as easily as I use to but still do not sleep well
I quit cold turkey not go to sugar coat it shit be the same as withdraw from meth year sober for I could not eat stomach hu all the time could not sleep shaky paranoid the list go on
I have bad anxiety   I dint sleep for   day   not even a nap
I be prescribe seroquel with lamictal and have a horrible allergic reaction extremely high fever and break out in a rash after read these comment I be thankful I have that reaction
I do seroquel with lamictal it give I severe reaction I have   be take lamictal for year but the combination be horrible I now do lamictal with effexor it seem to work for I
that be the only medication combo that have give I a reaction my doctor just prescribe I zoloft a few month ago I have just come off of lithium she literally say to I oh zoloft be go to help with your anxiety but if you be bipolar your symptom might get bad   my anxiety be too bad to stay and try to find another medication I just go with it so I guess we be play russian roulette with medication now   
it be horrid I hate it and will never use it again
horrible even when I taper off I have itch all over my body and have to take benedryl for like a month and a half this can happen because seroquel have antihistimine in it and your body be use to have a ceain amount run through it and when it dwindle you can itch terribly
oh god I have only be on it for a few month I be scared to read these comment
I have be on these med high dose for   and a half year I be try to reduce it down for the rd time each time be horrid I know the good and bad of these med and have have most of the bad side effect and bad withdrawl symtom and I be still scared to read this medication that work wonderfully for some people do not always work for other but if you do not try they out you will never know good luck and good wish to anyone on serequel from the uk
I be scared too I get a reaction like a rash light head and dizzy so now I break it in half I just do not have much energy wait to see the doctor
it be horrible
I be taper off in january and it be a fairly horrible experience lot of body ache and pain and just feel like I have the flu all the time plus totally emotionally all over the place eventually decide I be taper too fast   mg a week and when I slow down it get a bit well   I get to   mg and stop and then later get a horrible mania so have to go back to   but refuse to go back any high
when I be taper from it I get super restlesslike unable to sit down I cry a loti be very emotional it be not fun
go through taper now for rd time feel like you descibe beth oneill   I be glad I read what you say as it be make I feel less worried about it not be normal I could not remember what the tapering be like before as it be aweful but I be really unwell mentally too at the time thank you
I be prescribe mg xanax   times daily help my anxiety and I be able to sleep I be just really depressed due to the loss of my lil bro on the th of july he be only   and have wife and   kid service this saturday and I be an emotional wreck
my dr have I try lexapro after I refuse seroquel then cymbalta and finally wellbutrin the last one be awful for I feel horrible for   day dizzy and feel like the room be spin I just stop take it I be do try antidepressant
I can not really function unless I have it the time that I can not have it I get   shaky and nauseous and can not sleep at all it be not fun at all but seroquel make I feel like a normal person
they move I because my high level of absence not all for anxiety but other link reason such as my medication to help I sleep cause I to get migraine etc make I unreliable and they move I to a depament which could absorb my absence level well
I be hope to stay anonymous but want to respond to this   my manager be fully aware that the area I have be move to exacerbate my anxiety yet move I there anyway they be not interested in any kind of compromise
wee mac gregor think I have anxiety   be think it last few month do you agree xx
today moment involve some anxiety depression   a lot too despite good sleep the night before   
sorry to hear everyone problem I can relate because my daughter my boyfriend and myself have depression and anxiety my boyfriend and my daughter have it a little more bad than I but sometimes I feel suicidelly and that be why I be on antidepressant and also my boyfriend and now my daughter be on it too my thought and prayer be with everyone that be struggle andor go thru it                                 
and actually mean it but I know I be hard to love so I guess I should not be upset about it
april nelson thankyou hun   he have a lot of love from ceain people but he be confused about what be go on but he be slowly accept the diagnosis now we just miss he xxxx
and to actually truly deeply mean it but I think this day n age people confuse love with sex or what they can get out of someone
I like to believe that there be still more people who mean it then be confuse dani
not always some people do have that and their kid as well I have depression and anxiety plus my boyfriend and my daughter not all people be fake think before you speak please
yeah get your stuff and leave be with your family not someone who be go to stress you out do not live your life for he live it for yourself
because of my condition I drive for   year I hate it I understand your struggle it be a job and I make decent money at it I be glad I be   not drive any more I hope you can get out and do your own thing keep the faith
research n see if maybe in the next few stop on your route n see if you can get a bed at one of the women shelter from there you can get resource to either get you home or get you in a place of your own what a horrible experience and I be so sorry you be go thru this stand strong and remember even when its uncomfoable anything be well than be basically hold prisoner   you can do bad all by yourself
the struggle be real
yes all true but if I do not face all of my fear head on I become a prisoner in my own home it have take hard work and I be not quite where I want to be but I be live a well life then I do even a year ago never give up
I have get it bad it overwhelm I will not wish it on anyone
not to dismiss people with serious social anxiety but some people be just wire differently like add shyness stage fright etc its what this society define as normal I will get off my high horse now
I guess line up with everybody at starbuck every day do not count    selective social anxiety
nervous about this morning drive
do not realize that I have social anxiety
try to suppo someone who experience this be challenging and very sad for the person I know they want to be able to do these thing but become overwhelmed by fear and anxiety as above wish I have a magic wand right now
people do not even begin to understand unless they live with the struggle
the struggle be real as much for your love one as for yourself
it be a struggle at time
yes it be a strugglebut everyday I make and push myselfi be not go to let this define I  
that be an ssri be not it you might have high level of serotonin maybe dopamine as well already some people with ceain gene mutation react badly to ssri for that reason if its really bad low dose of no flush niacin can calm the anxiety from it temporarily def tell the doc
ok so I have major depressive disorder be on cymbalta for a few year when I recently realize I be sleep til   pm and really no interest in anything check into heritage eastside behavioral hospital so I could see my psyc doc   most psychiatrist do not take medicare as an outpatient he switch I to effexor which seem to work well but it be a serotonin norephrine reuptake inhibitor from what I have research it be the norephrine that provide a boost in energy it already seem to have level off in effectiveness at   mg I need more energy still since I be deal with a pc physician now any thought on suggestion I will bring up to she ie up dosage etc everyone of you out there experience these problem stay strong this come from a former ngc cadet
so I have bipolar   and a few other diagnosis like many people depression occur more often than mania there be new research just google stimulant use with depression or bipolar that show stimulant medication may help stimulant do not fix the depression but do provide some energy that help kick sta behavior that help deal with depression I can only take it for   day because of the mania that can occur however it be not unheard of to use stimulant this way also a doctor be always the good place to sta I wish any medication work for I it take I lot hard work to deal with my past to change my behavior and willingness to sit through the misery if someone can get help through medication please accept the help do not sit in misery you do not deserve
jeanette I have to disagree with you I be on a medication call vyvanse it be similar to adderall but it slowly go up level off and peak down it help I clarify my thought because I have bipolar and also anxiety disorder as well as adult add it do give I a little bit more energy to be able to proceed with my day so that be not   true
everyday I be take buspironeattivanviibridgabapentinrisperidone and trazodonei be suffer from extreme anxiety and fear of the unknown
I be think one second ahead and it work sometimes the bloody thing be I can not predict when it come and the thought of it come scare the shit out of I but some how I be still here after   time I be not go to say be strong because it do not work but I suppose be and find yourself in a environment where you be protect could be a help so call depression or what ever fucking suck I be   day in good for I but I know I be due soon good of luck      
oh hunny I do not self harm but I be teeter between homicide or suicide and I do not completely understand what be the pain killer but darlin I understand the search for something to take away the suffering and it in my case never stop even when I do my thing to numb or subdue the hu for awhile but it be there justso I will pray god to take that away from you and give you strength to stop I be afraid one day I be go to go to far and I actually pray for he to take I home I would say try get angry yep that be right get mad at the evil spirit that be do this to you thru you when you feel it come let it out of your mouth your feeling and speak to that bad thing and tell it how piss off you be and how you be a beautiful child of god and your body belong to he and say this I rebuke you you weak and defeat enemy you have no power here the holy blood of jesus christ give I authority to cast you unholy spirit into the void I say speak becauseeverythe in this world be create with a word and the power of life and death there dwell the tongue be the most powerful thing god love you and god bless you
need to be honest and ask for help as that be the way to recovery believe I I know what be like to be in the dark and confused and in constant pain please be honest with your provider there be a light at the end of the tunnel
I learn that sometimes the bad place make the good jumping point   it drive we to do well and be well be alone will not make your feeling and self harm disappear proper treatment will you need to use this scary place as something to drive you as you be clearly strong as fuck
reallydo not yellthat be a stresser  
ptsd I have it and I constantly be in the chaos of it along with bipolar personality disorder severe manic depression night terror that will not let I sleep I do not have my med I do not have the money for they I be either homicidal suicidal or fit of cry or in a state of paralyze fear home invasion molestation beat to the point of death rape and I just have pacemaker put in my mom mock I she say thing to purposely because I pain and she push until I be ready to do bad thingsi be alone no friend I be shun at family gathering not welcomedso I be constantly talk to god just like he be in the room and I hold nothing backi read his word and it will bring I peace and the feeling that he be with I and then mostly I sit alone with my dog and the affection from they make my hea feel betterbut I have realize that the fuher you be away from people who will make you flip your shit the more control and peace you will have they be poison to we they will light the fire or they will end up make you worse separate and disassociate from all negative and miserable people our sickness or what ever you want satan get strong when you be surround by they the difference between we and they be they be full of hatred and jealousy and they need to make we low than they so they can feel powerful justify its like they want to be the victim get away from they soon and talk to god pray and read your bible everyday
I usually get a manic episode in the end of march beginning of april and then again in august and yes my sex drive go in over drive I will not lie at first I kind of enjoy the mania after depression   the first day or so at least maybe but as other have say it be impoant to get back on a stabilizer to get it back under control   a few day without sleep   flu like symptom we sta forget what we be do and not evening know what be happen around we I be actually schizoaffective disorder bipolar type as well as ptsd with anxiety I know sometimes I feel I can go without med or I just hate the side effect   my fiance as much as I love he can be so unsuppoive when it come to my mental health but this be about you and your well be you come first
I be bipolar type   with ptsd and anxiety I also be seasonally affect it be common I take a small dose of antidepressant from octfeb annually because the depression be so bad in those season and some year I need a small additional mood stabilizer or antipsychotic in spring or summer for the hypomania sleeplessness racing thought anger overspend be a total busy beebut the med change keep the more severe reaction like suicidal thought at bay I be sorry about your paner that be truly not healthy and not good for your well be you need love and suppo
nope get mania in the summer be common increase sex drive be also common and be angry at the drop of a hat be also common you have just give textbook symptom of mania in bipolar disease   though it will be hard to do you need to get back on your med you need at least a mood stabilizer to get the mania under control   stop and stae the med do nothing to make the disease well and will give you more heabreak over your life   yes the med be awful and have awful side effect you need to work with your doctor to   find the good one for you just stop without discuss the side effect that be drive you crazy do you no good and do not let the doctor help you figure out how to deal with it   an example I be newly on buspar for anxiety it be cause double vision every day for about   hour I really hate that instead of stop I talk with the doctor and he make the suggestion to stop the morning dose and just take a big dose at bedtimetada no double vision in the daytime and I could care less if I have it while I be asleep    I have have bipolar   for   plus year or so and diagnose about   age   I be    trust I the range of medication option now be so so much well than in the s do yourself a favor and sta see a therapist a couple of time   a month to deal with the emotional fallout of you life and be bipolar and get back on the med they be the key   I wish you well in the journey we call life
I find it hard deal with repressed childhood abuse and trauma I have not be diagnose with bipolar   I have ptsd anxiety and depression   you can pull through my darling think about all the thing you have not yet achieve think about all the experience you be yet to gain meditation and conscious breathing help I chill   as well as a spliff when I have money your bf be a cnt for say that
my ex try work well but keep relapsinghelpe with the anxiety and tremor
zoloft be a good script your go to have anxiety   but the zoloft will help with that ask your psych doctor because it may cause depression
I would exhaust all medication option first I have extra it do not work and the memory loss be awful I now can not drive long distance as I can not remember direction or follow they I get confused thank to extra try every other option first
sorry my comment include a few error it only helped alleviate my symptom for approximately one month not week I would not recommend it there be a new similar therapy that be supposedly similar it be tmcs which stand for tran magnetic cranial stimulation I be unsure regard it be availability and whether or not insurance cover it
I have   ect treatment several year ago I be in a very deep depression for over   year that no other treatment or med would help it help I a lot if I ever have to I would go through it again you definitely need good suppo go through it as it be hard on your body and your memory but it be well woh the work the first treatment be a little scary as you do not know exactly what to expect
I have   ect in   and it work but the side effect and memory loss be ridiculous I regret every treatment but my family direct the foctor to do it I have no choice my sho term loss and long term loss be both screw its horrible I can not remember my kid grow up I can not remember bihday and little thing that make meme I would not do it if I be you I would try all medication before ect
hi I have   ect treatment   year ago for severe depression that be resistant to all other treatment and medication it be very beneficial for I although I now have huge chunk of my life that I can not remember which be upset I would rather have that than try and fight the depression everyday if you have the suppo you will need I would say have the ect all the good
I find this to be false type   diabete bipolar ptsd severe depression anxiety problem they be all treat as something that be my fault I do not ask for any of it every day people tell I just to suck it up I be tell at least once a week that I should not have eat so much candy as a kid blah blah blah I be probably one of the small kid in my school be always active and outside play run ride my bike and yet here we be be blame for some shit I have no control over fuck you world fuck you
caitlin summars I do not think I be be bias I be be very understanding to both side in your first comment you definitely be be one side consider you yourself struggle with mental illness I can not understand your lack of empathy you state in your first comment a diabetic illness can take a life unlike a chemical imbalance that be all you say no explanation   I completely disagree with that   no one should prefer to be label crazy I have have family member die of cancer   they have definitely have more sympathy through their struggle than a person with a mental affliction love   understanding to all I will say no more
cherie I do not underestimate mental illness at all both my son and I have adhdi also have anxiety and depression most day I be suicidalthough I would not actually take my lifei think about it constantly I battle every day to get upto interact with othersand I have struggle all of my life to hold down a job to suppo my family   I have also watch diabete because thought of suicide in my young sister she try to take her own life through her disease its all awfulit all hus and its all a struggle my point be if we go threefive day without psychiatric med there be no guarantee we would be deadbut if a diabetic go that long they most ceainly would be stigma attach to diabete also because feeling of guilt isolation maybe because your experience be one side its a bit biased towards mental illness I have and do deal with both daily
depression and other mental condition can cause suicide the stigma associate with mental illness because more suffer guilt isolation and sometimes drive people to take their own life I agree one disease should not be compare to the other   I feel for you and your son but do not underestimate the pain of have a mental disorder   in my experience the stigma be great
I be a diabetic and have depression and anxietydid not want either
yes play solitaire it take your mind off you   be the good for I to relieve anxiety
yes I think about death all the time especially my family after my mother expire I develop major depression and anxiety I feel as though if something bad happen to my family it will take I off the edge I will be back at the beginning just do not want that to happen
I think the fear and anxiety you feel when think about death be it be not that your scared of die but leave your family and the one you love most behind that be what I tell myself anyway and it kind of help a little maybe try keep yourself busy find a hobby or something and do that when you feel a anxiety attack come it should help x
ovehinke be our bad enemy I apply to everything lead to anxiety lead to insanity
I use to have severe panic attack about my mother die before I be put on med I write down a list of thing I want to imagine instead what would my life be like if I have the power to shapeshift what would I do if I meet the avenger and loki what situation would cause I to meet these people same as above but with a celebrity I like if I be a villain what would I be after what if I have control of fire and ice imagine own a team of six spos dog what breed and what spos would I like
it be a catch   sometimes you be so fetup you want to end it all then you be obsess with the thought of die this can swirl for ever in my head
I understand what you mean I go through stage that I do not want to be here anymore and be pain free sometimes I do not want to die I just do not want too exist sometimes I want to die then I have time where I think about die and once you be dead that be it you be go forever and my stomach turn and I freak out so much it be a horrible feeling but I just can not help when it happen and stop think about it x
I know this do not solve anything but try find a book series or tv show that you can really get into it help both my husband and I to be distract by something when we be feel anxiousscareddepressed you may even be able to train your brain to relax just by have the show on in the background again I know it be not a fix but sometimes we need a temporary solution while we wait for the big fix like med and counseling and the like to sta work their magic
it could be a medicine or combination of med that trigger the thought I staed take trintellix and now I be get anxiety attack plus other unpleasant sideeffect   my last anxiety attack I force myself to mentally walk through a place that bring I happiness a place with many happy memory attach to it I have to force myself to remember those happy memory but the attack subside after about   minute I be still very agitated though and I do not sleep well for a couple day but even with all that it be well than the anxiety attack
well I have a medication that trigger night terror make sure first that it be not link to some of your medication otherwise I would have to get up turn on the light take a bath do something to   keep myself from go down the rabbit hole yeah I guess I use distraction technique to derail my brain
sound like you afraid of death or die I be like that big time   but have to redirect my thought its hard keep my mind busy something you like to do I be on lexamil be tough at first but I have to learn to cope
it be not that I be think of kill myself when I have these thought it be that I get scared thinking about how I be go to die and what death be like
I too and not only recently most of my life suddenly I sta think about death and I give myself a panic attack which make I feel like I be die right now it be awful
do not be afraid you will meet the king when you pass
I turn to gratitudegrateful for my job parent brother house friend kidsreally come into perspective when I see a homeless person with daily life strugglesbring I brief relief from depressive thought
death be our only transpo to meet the creator no one be immune to it be thankful and have gratitude lessen the anxiety about it you can be thankful even for the small thing like comment hereother be blind some be fingerless some do not have phone etc in everything we need to be thankful appreciation go a long way even if our family member sometimes think we be act out but love cover a multitude of sin I really love your comment
thought of death be a common theme with depressionevery day the thought of my own demise crosse my mindthey say live your life like its your last day but in reality the thought of die scare the shit out of most people
just do not think about it it happen to I too when I think on it and it use to be bad back after my first anxiety attack where I would not even step foot outside   but now I have realize that it be apa of life and there be not anything anyone can do about it so I do not bother think about it I think about how to make my time here woh it
lol the thing be I be not that be how I cope with my anxiety if something be cause I anxiety I have train myself to not even bother think about it because the moment I do anxiety creep back in   everyone have different cope method
I have same problem I want to die but can not when upset it feel like nothing leave
withdrawal be a bitch   to   week of misery I just go off prozac and zyprexa but I do it at home because I could not function psychiatrist always want to drug we I be on mild xanax and non habit form hydroxizine    visteral andye I have extreme high and low but I would rather have that than the side effect of all that other shit it take about   week to detox plus I detox from cigarette too tough but doable
I have similar withdrawal after stop wellbutrin do not dose down and have problem for about   day doubt that help because all med be different but I wish you well
I feel like my life be be rob by bipolar I scare I and I do not iknow how to stop it
true but it also give you a chance to recreate yourself in a brand spank new way a way that give you a chance to be the person you could never be with out live through it it give you the oppounity to map out your life as you want it to be have stuff but we be all so woh the work and struggle to beat this it be forever my friend but I choose how to live
I have the mental capacity to become something extraordinary maybe a surgeon a fighter pilot the sky be the limit then depression come along and destroy memy intelligence go to wastemy life be go down the drain in a clockwise downward spirali fear n have no hope for the future my life be technically half over n I have achieve very littlei exsist I be not live to my full potential I may as well b an enatimate object
anxiety yes I havehell it feel
depression n anxiety go hand in hand make it hard to function efficiently
you can not stop the stigma it will always remain because people hate n fear what they do not understandit be there since the dawn of time
still battle doctorstherapistspsychiatristsmedsnever end it seem and my   yr old pick up slight anxiety from I and I feel horriblenow he be in counseling too help he now so he do not turn out like I   
do not give we a placebo give we a fucking curei have try so many medication nothing relieve s the pressure in my head
watch your breathing during a panic attack you will breathe more rapidly and shallowly take deep breath more slowly can help
I would try to wait to take the xanax until the morning or until a trigger be begin it be onset be usually minute and be use in panic attack more so as they have a shoer duration hrs then many of the other benzo hrs
anxiety med may slso be adhd
mine get bad sometimes music will pull I out or be busy with a focused activity that I enjoy like bake or color I use the calm app and do a meditation if they be race and I be anxious or try to sleep sometimes I have to get my med bump up they just will not stop until I do it have last week before good luck
find a physical activity my mind run away on I all the time it be hard but in the last year I have take up running and I now run a lot if my mind can run I to panic my leg can run my to calm or physical exhaustion
mindfulness will change your life focus back to the present moment do wonder mindfulness be a hard skill to learn so try not to get upset at yourself if you lose focus keep practice and have it become a pa of your lifestyle
look up mindfulness on the internet you can even get app for your phone it help you focus on the here and now and the anxiety drift away it have be a godsend
I would stick   it through the appointment next week see if he be willing to go back on some so of mood stabilizer you might have to set up an agreement about supervise med he leave they so you can see that he be take they   without the med this be only go to get bad so then you have a right to protect yourself a trial separation might jolt he a bit into make the change he need   you mention sleep apnea interrupted sleep be a huge issue for bipolar do he have some so of machine or oral device to stop the apnea   I know the affair be hard know it be probably the bipolar talking but not sure how much that help   I have be bipolar   for   year just have an huge long deep mania at some point I list our house for sale    now that they decide I can indeed have the only mood stabilizer that work for I tegretol and I be back to a therapeutic level I realize how horrible I be to my husband and I apologize several time a day I make very concrete plan to leave he during the three month and be in general a bitch to live with   now that the doc have quit do experiment with I I love he so so much for be able to stand it all   all I can say for I be the medication be key the side effect be horrible and piss I off every time I look in a mirror and see how fat I be and every time I be thirsty but can have no liquid   they take I off tegretol due to a low sodium level no other mood stabilizer work and for a year I just go crazy now they have decide I can have the tegretol but have to limit fluid and eatdrink a ton of sodium   bipolar be a serious disease and just go without the med for a prolong period be really really hard   it be not something you can think yourself out of   will be happy to chat with your husband if you think he would talk to meand that it would help
this be a tough situation but not uncommon   I be diagnose with bp   ii more than   year ago and still struggle with take med most if not all of the med use have side effect and some be bad than the bipolar itself   the only thing you can control in this situation be you but you can continue to encourage he to take the med   there be many med available and everyone respond differently to they   he can tell his psych he want to try something different because he can not tolerate the side effect   I have also find that supplement magnesium and vitamin d help I tremendously   you may want to suggest something like that as well   keep in mind that you can not force someone to do something and threaten typically do not help   focus on you and take care of yourself and let the rest work itself out
the struggle with med be pretty common onoff etc    I do not make very good decision when I be manic what he be sayingdoe might be symptom rather than reality I be not sure of course I hope thing get well  
I have bpd bipolar   ptsd adhd depression anxiety and ocdi have be on effexor mg lamictal mg intuniv mg for   year now since I be   it be be the most helpful combination of med they have ever try and I have try well over   med since I be diagnose at   year old
often time these illness go hand in hand so it be not uncommon to have multiple diagnosis   since there be no test diagnosis be make base on behavior over a period of time   I have bp ii and have be on more med than I can count over the year   I also have thyroid problem but it have nothing to do with the med   it seem to be more related to the bp itself   if you be have problem with weight gain tell your doctor to try a different med   there be many available that be do not because weight gain   I have learn over the year that you have to be your own advocate   do your research   research the different med available nutrition supplement etc and do not hesitate to   make suggestion to your doctor   if you can not tolerate ceain side effect speak up   if your doctor do not listen to you find a new doctor
I take cymbalta right now mg and abilify mg all the other antidepressant either do not work or make I sicki be major deppressiongeneral anxietybi polar and fibromyalgia so far that be what I have
it cause I to have panic attack and all I want be some sleep
wellbutrin xl be an amazing medication I tell doctor that it help I with my patience and tone down my anger issue I be also on lamictal and without it I be sho fuse and irritable so in combination they seem to work pretty decent   I hope you find the right combination for you also staed latuda for   week and it be great my mind do not feel bogge down and heavy it be like a refresher and clean the negativity from my brain

addict brain be not the same as a non addict I never say addiction be not real either simply that it be the fault of the addict and the addict only   back to the brain   an addict brain deteriorate over time but only by choice hate to break it to you if you do not touch the shit in the first place you will not have to worry about kill your brain my   year old mother be an addict and I hate she now because she choose meth over my sister   she act like a   year old by choice because she put the pipe to her lip in the first place

I can relate to you with the weight gain and med I be currently reduce mine I understand if no one else do that put weight on effect your mental state aswel and diet do exist and so do exercise but until people realise that some med make it so no matter what you do it do not work I also understand about living be hard I have suffer something similar and for that I see a councillor and work through it it do not happen overnight but you can get through it with determination that it be not go to takeover your life mindfulness if you do it properly do work for trauma I feel your pain and know how hard life can be but you can work through it and succeed in your life your   and have be through hell but take control and you win not they I know you can do it just take one day at a time and you will be able to have a life it never go away but you can deal with it the thing you have be through do not define you as a person it be go to be hard and your go to have to deal with feeling that be overwhelming but believe I I can talk about it without feel anything now because I have take control and so can you I hope this have help take care and remember one day at a time xx
the person who get kill may wish they be alive to tell the tale like you   they never get the option it must be hard to live with all this but consider other who will not even share here for fear sometimes we have to acknowledge life be tough and move on your chance be university to move on and put a line under the past you can either let who do this to you ruin your life or make they aware you survive and can do more you can and will achieve and do not use anything as a crutch hold that head up you can and you will do it the oprion be stay in this state which be no good and well you have try it to see no one realy help so fight and stay strong and move on if you do not make it sorry no one do it for you
I be give it once and I be well old now so do not judge everyone to need your way out in deep depression   you may not be able to accept another to lean on there be many way and yes people survive   other have not   argument like your instigate because stress so you be cause grief here unnecessary through your misinterpretation   the main teenager maybe bright and more able now enough
if I have an infection in my body antibiotic will in fact cure I of that infection   resting will help I feel well fast but that be not what will heal I   people do help   if it be not for my friend and family be there by my side and suppoe I I would not be able to make it through life   yes I have to do the hard work myself but anything that help I without hue I be much need in survive a mental illness   the thing that do not help be just try to hold my head up and stay strong and move on   if it be that simple nobody would have anxiety or ptsd or depression or any other mental illness   I be not try to give you a hard time but tell someone that be swiftly sink into the pit of darkness that nobody can help they be fucking bullshit   nobody can do the work for I but they can help I from fall too far   and that be an impoant thing to remember   sometimes it really do take more than strategic planning and hope for the good
excuse I but in say not to use anything as a crutch and that no one help and if she fail oh well be you advise this depressed traumatized girl beg for help not to seek professional treatment and medication and to just live with herself in a suicidal state   medication and therapy be not crutche any more than my blood pressure medicine or allergy medicine be   no more than my friend insulin be   by your reasoning it be a bad thing my brother go and get surgery and bar and pin put in his ankle when he break it in   place   he should have just live with it in the state it be and if he be crippled for life oh well   I be sorry for what ever you go through in your life to make you devalue everyone else but please let we not turn this suppo page into a place we basically tell people to go ahead and kill themselves
hi sweethea I be sorry you be go through such trauma at a young age I hope you have receive rape counseling and   ptsd counseling and therapy it sound like you be suffer terribly at your age I would not want to gain weight either any age really but because you be so young your body be still change so you might not have such a bad problem I do not know because the med I be on do not effect I like that   I be be treat for bipolar major depression and anxiety I be also a recover alcoholic and prescription drug abuser   I know it seem impossible to even think you will get well but you will if you really want to but you have to do some of the work there be antidepressant that actually suppress the appetite prozac wellbutrin have that effect you might ask your doctor about those so remember we need more strong young people like you in the world   go to university you will love it I bet they have counseling for everything you have be through and suppo group good luck at school
I be diagnose with depression at   and it be later change to bipolar depression when I be   I end up have severe panic attack from the age of   to   I be also rape my ex fiance cousin we be room with he at the time rape I and my ex do not believe I I be kick out in the middle of the night it be cold and rain my dad live a   minute drive away I be   now and marry and be pregnant with our third child I still relive my rape everyday even though it happen   year ago and my rapist stalk I for a very long time after that but trust I life move on and get well if you need to talk I be here

I be so sorry that you have be through so much at such a young age   you can get through this   you need a good doctor to work closely with you    it may be that you will need to continue on medication and counselling   even when you feel well because go off to college and study will be stressful and you will need to be able to cope
I feel the world hate I and afraid of everyone but love everyone I do not fit in either but we be not suppose to fit in how do we help each other if we be all the same or think alike you be not alone   
I suffer from depression and anxiety and ptsd and I be marry as well with a child and I be willing to talk to you and your husband you all be more than   welcome to come hang with we my husband suffer from   ptsd as well and I be also anti social but like I say I be willing to talk to you all
you be normal the depression and anxiety be not you be not the only one I have see the depth of hell during depression
I suffer from both depression and anxiety I go to a menta l health center where I join in and socialize with people and go on outing where do you live I live in new york state
your afraid to talk to your doctor because you think he will tell you offi feel exactly tha same when I stop all my med suddenly then have to go back as I be so ill my doctor tell I well that be unwise bet you will not do it again   but do not raise his voice or tell I off so please go chicsende you hug x x
ty I doubt a pill wil fix my thought at all do not see how as I be straight up before w they and tell they specific phrase run throw my mindpill given never stop these chemical imbalancei do not see it though maybe I be wrongi seem to never find relieve and try literally all option know even talkingto my dr I have know for year tell she that I self talk badly exact phrase to be exact n no thingi be give up tired if thiseven prayingno sign of happiness n relief I be lose
this be normal with both   and   my dad get really bad at one point when he would think he be well and chop my baby bed up into piece while I be still in it   I grow ul and have bipolar   and have a manic spending problem that leave I bankrupt   you be not alone in this cycle   if I be off my med for   hour I sta freak out and have panic attack   I would definitely see a new dr   that you feel comfoable with   and check your blood level too   because these med mess up your liver too
go to your doctor be honest and stay on your med I would be afraid to go off mine I already have the slight over spend problem   every time you go off of they the hard to readjust do the right thing stay on your med
I can relate I be currently have the problem of restlessness and need to move but I also do not feel like move if you need to talk I be here
this sound like a mixed episode be you on a mood stabilizer before you stop take your medicine if you be you may be have a rebound effect it may take some time for the drug to rebuild to an effective level in your body most psych med be not instant do talk to your doctor as soon as possible but do not panic   I be the queen of mixed episode and I speak from experience mix episode be intensely uncomfoable but they always pass you will not feel like this forever try to sit tight keep your hand busy and fight the urge to do anything reckless or selfdestructive if you feel like jump out of your skin valerian tea be soothe and may help a bit til you can get to the doc and in the future if your med be work stay on they lot of luck
the good way to avoid the big rollercoaster up and down be to stay on med all the time especially a mood stabilizer it be so hard I fight it too not want my diagnosis or to need med but I know I be well off stable you have to make that appointment and you need to go regularly it help so much I be glad you have a suppoive husband mine have be amazing even when I spend we into a crazy amount of debt or baked bread and cookie like a maniac on a four day sleepless bender good luck and hug
I have not use lithium just quetiapine but stop that as I be pile on weight and now the aripirazole   be there any other cause for it that you know of I struggle around my period anyway because I have get endometriosis but never think about the thyroid thing thank for the reply I appreciate it redhea x
werid be you on a mood stabilizer be under extra pressure
you need to look after yourself if he be not willing to see a psychiatrist or doctor you should risk your own mental wellbeing to help he hug x
if he s up   down all the time it can make you be mood go like that I be marry for   yrs   my ex husband have I   the kid walk on egg shell all the time plus my childhood my dad   be    vioent to my mother include   drug an alcohol both those time in my life leave I with depression   severe anxiety be around toxic people can bring you down   I hope thing get well but if his not willing to get help you should think about leave he my ex do same thing say same thing about my friend since I leave he iv be able to be myself happy for once
I understand its hard I have to get away from my boyfriend because he be always yell and punch thing with his anger issue and all and it make my depression and anxiety much bad
I do not think she be say that she be catch schizophrenia or bipolar but she can end up be depressed and anxious from deal with his constant complicated paranoid changeable unmedicated mental state   just for the record too you can not catch schizophrenia but his paranoia can eventually because she to be paranoid as well   if she be go to be his caregiver she may need to get therapy for herself   she may need medication for herself   she may need suppo from a caregiver suppo group   she need to seek assistance for herself   she can not help he if she can not help herself   after she be in a healthy state of mind and he be see she go to therapy he may consider give it a chance again himself
it be not a rational decision    it be a release from the pressure and anxiety   and sometimes from the numb depression    it be be able to feel something anything when you feel nothing it be to validate anxiety and stress when there be no reason for it    it be an irrational grab for control over anything even pain it be almost always regret as soon as it sta but it rarely even can be stop and it be almost never for attention I understand and you be not alone    
self harm be something we learn to do to cope with a pain or trauma that we either can not face or will not face   sometimes we do not even know what it be we have block it it can actually release endorphin   the bodys own natural pain killer like morphine   so even though we feel a little pain from the cut we might actually feel good from the endorphin so in a strange way we use it as a poor form of therapy it help we avoid a large pain and it make we feel well the trick be to develop well cope technique to help we feel well and to find someone safe that we can divulge   or discover what the real problem be and then get well
no pressure though I be   after all   a stranger to you
you need to see a psychiatrist as soon as possible get on some med there be help and suppo out there my anxiety and depression be so bad I about give up on life please see a psych dr I pray you will be well I finally give in and seek help it be hard but I have to do it
I need this right now my fincee leave I on friday to go back home   be together for   year   my ptsd bi polar anxiety n depression be very high   I do not have a clue on what I be do half the time   I hate feel so confused n wohless all the time   all I do all day be think about she and worry about her
when I be anxious it be because I be bipolar when I be depressed it be because I be bipolar I have zero control over either
this be not mean to demean anyone for I anxiety have be cause from try to control thing out of my control that be happen around I or that I think will happen and the depression be cause by my sadness that thing have happen and I can not do anything to change it we all suffer differently   s
actually be not that a buddhist belief   now what you say be indeed true   thinking about and worry about the future can lead to anxiety just as live in the past can bring about depression   the thing be we be extremist and anything or sometimes nothing can trigger these reaction
I dread the future no reason to and I live my past over and over
I also have bipolar depression and anxiety I think the good assistance you can provide yourself be to see another professional   as you age your diagnosis can change as you as a person have change   regardless seek some help medication will help you level out emotionally and take stock in what need to be do
hi   I suffer bipolar aswell and have emotionally unstable personality disorder mine mean that I be impulsive and irrational it be to do with how your child hood impact on your way of grow up for instance my dad be a drinker and beat my mother my mother be cold and show no emotion or love and other aspect of my life make it hard to let my emotion grow with become an adult you should ask your dr what kind of personality disorder you have and why she think that hope this have help good luck with get your answer x
I have   session over   week this past june my psychiatrist have I stop because my sho term memory be non existent I be stae to get some back but do not help with my depression and make my anxiety through the roof
there be a new medication be infuse at the hospital I work at ketamine therapy google it woh a shot if you be reluctant to shock therapy
it be be suggest to I to try ect from my psychiatrist but I have be hesitant due to the potential loss of memory I be extremely resistant to most antidepressantsantipsychotic but for some people it have work wonder
or I get the you can not dwell in the past forever or I have be there when they do not have it I hate especially the snap out of it if you think that will work you have no idea what I feel or go thru
normal people can not comprehend how a seemingly happy person be a threat to themselves the isolation cause by fear of misunderstanding be deadly
that be more like it I feel like sometimes this be a place to wallow in depression and anxiety an upbeat post be refreshing
well I have have two record hea attack and twice last eek I literally dream I be die and awake with severe chest painsi live in hell isolatedmy family daughter hate mei sacrifice my goal for they never touch I and I be too tough one my eld try to protect her innocent soul and now I be die alonethey refuse for   year to speak to I deny I meeting or hug they again or meet my grandchildrenso I have go off my   med refuse to kill myself afraid of the legacybut seek to die soonwithout ever know love again but escape the horrible sear pain of depressioni at be my end

I worry about the consequence of ask for help
well I be bring up that ask for help be a sign of weakness still struggle with this everyday
do not be afraid of how you feel and ask for help it take a strong brave person to ask for help not a sign of weakness that be just ignorance stay strong   s
try not to be afraid you know you need they because they work it will be well woh it when you have child something magical usually happen they consume so much of our time   and our think process   especially when they be as young as your son revolve mainly on they I do not think you will forget to take care of your son need by any means it be clear he be your sunshine   I too be anorexic before my first bear after I have he it stabilize focus on the long term reward if you can good luck to you  
at   mg it give I horrible thought once they put I on a low dose which be   mg the thought be bearable and nearly go away it be not to bad it help ease the depression and stuff everyone be different though
I be on mg and it change my life for the well my doctor be worried about my weight gain so now I be on mg I split the pill in half and I be still pretty good although I have bad anxiety since lower the dose but my doctor also do not want to go back up she want to sta gradually taper I off at some point when I be feel really stable in my life
mg abilifly for I work great I take at night staed at mg and lower the dose until I and my doctor feel it be not make I like a very quite personwhich I be notnow for about year I have be at mg enjoy everyday right now life be pretty good my anxiety attack have be few and far between personality be up I can get manic but I do not get depress too bad anymore   hope your med help you out like I just work on the dosage with your drgood luck
hate it it actually make my anxiety so high I be afraid to leave my apament will never go back on it
after month of find the right dose I feel great side affect I have be weight gain but I know that would happen it be still easy to lose the weight I just need to exercise more and eat right but mentally I have to have the right dose to feel well I can not remember my dose my mom be the one who control my pill after a scare she have last year not relate to abilify as I be not on it back then
give I high blood pressure they tell I I could have have a stroke walk
people make I feel guilty if I   try any of those
same I think ceain people in my life that once could not accept it be stae to I be the one who place the guilt on myself after I say I can not do something due to my anxiety ect not fun but in reality we have to take care of ourselves first
and I   maybe we sta to think thst we arr let people make we feel guilty or that we make ouselvrs feel guilty eeasier say than do though
I be on that exact same dose and I have severe anxiety attack when I do not take they
have be on they now for almost two year be the same way which be why I staed only thing I find that stop I cry be anxious depressed and stop the unwanted thought and feeling I still can not get through a day without they otherwise I be a complete mess message I if you want
I be on mg if I miss one pill I would lose my shit I would be emotional snap very easily I would eat a lot more that day I would just be a total mess I have be need to sta they again but I be to scared of go through the first week with they settle in now I have a son
same feeling   I go up to   mg as I be juggle grad school family with a daughter have mental issue and a full time job as a ms teacher at a treatment facility   I would cry from stress and anxiety   just graduate so stae to feel a little more even but I can even think about not take my med in fear I would drown in a deep dark hole   I be lucky my husband understand
I hope you will come into contact with many other who understand on here I be sure people will confirm that many of the thing you be think and feeling be common and normal   in no way be you a failure   I see ad as merely a crutch to help you along the path to recovery   it be definitely not a sign of failure I would say exactly the opposite you be aware enough that you just need some help   it be a sign of strength and honesty   many people need some form of help in their life medically mental illness be no different our mind be so complex sometimes they just   do not work properly   I do worry though if people begin to feel well this be sometimes when we might feel we no long need the ad and come right off they it be sometimes the case when people with a mental health condition feel that they be do really well and begin to run before they can walk and possibly take on too much come off medication too fast or too soon might not necessarily work if some other challenge or difficult situation come along in the long term   it be not a sign of weakness if we need they it sound as though you ve have a lot on your plate be strong for your son it can take so much out of a parent be there for those who rely on you try not to be too hard on yourself you ve do really well in acknowledge you need some help accept the condition be a huge step towards recovery when some can not admit they be suffer    small step be key to an eventual goal lean on those who care for you and let people help you you can do this there be hope for we all xx well wish x
stop beat urself up need med do not mean you r weak and I would ceainly nothing to be ashamed of
same here I be off med as they be not help I in anyway I be depress from last   month I be   and jobless from last   year I leave my job think my life will be stress free but the depression never go and I continue to live with bipolar for eternity
fail at what you will never not have bipolardepression it what you be struggle with   so if   you think you could make it go away then yes you fail to accomplish the impossible its not about never feel depression or mania and never struggle   its about manage your inner state so you can live well   so let we see   you have several time come out if depression that can kill people stuck with your crisis team a long time when you need they be raise a special need child recognize what be happen do something about it and damn girl you be not fail at any single thing even a little you be discourage and maybe intimitate   but you be not a failure
there be no shame in take med I be on seraline aka zoloft too just staed it   week ago from be on effexor xr for year it seem to be work but it affect peep differently your only a failure when you fail to try
I know how you feelyou pick yourself up only to fall again it be a struggle   bipolar be like that   I try get out in nature when I be depressed or exercise but sometimes you be so tired I knowbut you have to push yourselfthink of yourself as a demand coach for you to be well   if you do it before you can do it again push through   
you must be brave and do what it necessary perhaps some medication be wise during this difficult time take note of the side effect of different medication thing will get easy just take a bit of time rest when you can look after you be son do not stress too much if poss or take too much extra on do what you need to look after child and esp urself x
I have be on effoxor for over   year staed at   I be on mg along with othet anxiety medsif you want to talklet I no I just do not want to put all my business out therekeep your chin up
I be not sure why you get off but I would see your doctor and sta back on med do not be afraid   I be sorry for what you be go through but now you need to think about yourself   get up tomorrow shower take a walk then next week call your doctor so this do not go on much long for you it sound like you need the med
think of you and pray for you for you your family and your struggle xo with lot of love and suppo
I suggest the book love someone with bipolar disorder as a staing off point maybe go to counsel together your husband need to understand your illness if he be to help you in turn it help he and those three boy who do not ask to be bring into this world or situation if they be too young to understand that mommy be sick they be not too young to understand tension and strife between you and your husband the two of you together owe it to they to do what you can to make this situation right good luck
I would maybe travel so that you can get away from your home stress and relax maybe take a close family member or friend with you it will help clear your mind plus it sound like you deserve to treat yourself
propranolol   seraquel   lamictal it lower my blood pressure
I take both propanolol and lamictal and my doc and I be lean towards a bipolar   diagnosis the propanolol be essential for I for an internal tremble and keep my blood pressure in mind the big side effect I have notice be my physical stamina be effect less endurance out of breath more easily the lamictal for mood stabilization for have not show any side effect and I have avoid the constant up and down mood since stae it a few week ago for I the combination be essential and effective with little side effect
I be on mg propranolol twice a day for a minor hand tremor which my doctor and I believe be relate to my ptsd and anxiety and so far it be seem to help with minimal side effect I be also on mg effexor in the morning mg epilim twice a day mg miazapine at night mg endep at night and mg seroquel at night
I have take propranolol as a prn for anxiety and it work well and it do not because any drowsiness
I be on both one anxiety lamictl for bipolar one work great no side effect
propranolol be use for anxiety it be actually a beta blocker but my doctor have I on it strictly for anxiety it work for I
I currently take propanolol it be a beta blocker primarily use to treat high blood pressure I take it to lower my heasuit hea rate
propanololinderal be a beta blocker it have multiple use and potentially can reduce anxiety by reduce blood pressure I take it as a migraine preventativei have be take lamictal   in vary dose   for   year and it be a wonderful medication one of my child have bp as well and have be on it for year I have find the side effect to be minimal and the med to be highly effective
hi I take lamactil as lamotrigine   mg a day   in one dose instead of   night and morning as a mood stabiliser and   mg or   mg of efexor for depression andor anxiety top up when not stable with   mg of olanzapine as zyprexa at night work in together well only downside be in aust anyway they lamictal be not on the pbs pharmaceutical benefit scheme and the olanzapine lead usually to lot of weight gain
I use to be on lamictal but be take off because of bad side effect but do not remember what   and I have be on for quite some time propranolol which be actually a high blood pressure me I believe but not for anxiety or bipolar   I be on lithium for the bipolar which have give I permanent hand tremor and the propranolol be to combat they   and I be just so so lucky sarcasm that the lithium do not help the bipolar and the propranolol do not help the tremor   sorry I be of no help
propranolol be a beta blocker that be use for hea arrhythmia but be also use for anxiety it can also lower bp but very slightly
propranolol make my blood pressure too low and lamictal make my migraine bad and more frequent
I be on lamictal propanolol and citalopram it be a good combo for I propanolol take away the physical symptom of anxiety but not the thought
propanalol make my anxiety x bad and because palpitation
propranolol work well with I I be also on abilify and lamictal the only thing be that it do have a tendency on lower your hea rate and blood pressure so I do look out for that with my pulse oximeter exclude blood pressure
I take lamactil for my epilepsy bibi also suffer from manic depressionanxietyptsd and it work wonderfully with my other med   anx it have keep I seizure free for almost a year now
oh I become a psycho on keppra literally psychotic hearing voice suicidal homicidal see thing paranoid angry all the time my boyfriend do not even want to come home   I be only on topamax and wellbutrin now which have be awesome for I still have some seizure though just not as often but the mood stabilization be spot on keppra do not stop they be not a good dose
propanalol be a beta blocker you can be anxious yet your hea rate will not increase I find it effective with no side effect
I have to share this because we be talk about lithium   my brother be on a diuretic for high blood pressure and the psychiatrist put he on lithium   the two should have not be give together   they together cause his kidney to fail but before they do he swell up in his abdomen leg scrotum and private pa so much with water that water be seep from his skin and his skin be split open   a nursing home do not know what be go on   he get admit to a hospital and they call in a kidney specialist and he know exactly which diuretic he be to have with lithium   on the right diuretic he lose foy pound of fluid   they be kill he with the wrong med
I stop lithium suddenly in pregnancy and be ok but it be v risky look out for sign of relapse and seek help urgently or re sta med
can you find another psychiatrist I would suggest do that I know it be frustrating to be on med but if you have find that they help you have every right to get that help can you contact your primary care doctor I apologize if other have already write the same thing I have not read all the comment yet I wish you the good do not be afraid to advocate for what you need as a human you have a right to have someone help you with your mental illness please take care and update we if you get a chance I care even though I do not know you
frankly it be irresponsible of your dr to stop your med quickly like that he should have give you warn that he would be leave his practice and arrange to fax your file to a new dr to continue your treatment the withdrawal can be super awful and agitate your condition immensely disassociation depression appetite flux suicidal thoughtsfeeling nauseavomiting and several other thing just off the two drug you mention that be say you need to see a new dr as soon as possible even if you have to see your primary care dr for a month refill while you find a new psychiatrist your medication should only be stop under dr supervision for your benefit not because a dr be leave play yoyo w your med be dangerous if your primary care dr will not refill you can seek out an urgent care dr or an emergency room visit they can verify w the pharmacy of your prescription and lack of refill if you no long have your pill bottle ps I have find the effexor tablet have easy withdrawal symptom than the capsule you just have to take they more often may be something you want to ask about   and the above person comment about smoking pot let I say that I be not encourage you to do anything illegal but if it be legal in your statearea I would suggest use it while your med get back into your system it ease your anxiety alone would be helpful but please do not use alcohol your liver and kidney be go through enough w the med
lithium withdrawal happen quickly with dissociative state mess up blood pressure dizziness disorientation lightheadedness confusion and after a few week possible organ failure   effexor withdrawal take   day to kick in and include tremor hot flash chill sweat fatigue inability to sleep nauseavomite dizziness severe headache and sudden severe depression typically bad than your depression be to begin with I be on lithium mg for   year and experience withdrawal once after   day when my mom be in the hospital for   day and only she have access to my med they be lock up   I have be on effexor for about   year now and experience withdrawal once after   day when I be put in jail for   day for miss community service and they take   day to get my med order   both I be warn about when I be put on he med in the first place of the impoance of not miss they or let myself run out because these withdrawal problem be real and intense and I experience every single withdrawal symptom both time except with the lithium I be not off long enough for organ failure to set in
prudence lowe benjamin yeah while I be here a woman have a seizure due to they not get her lamictal order in a timely matter due to that I get my lamictal soon than any other because I make a big deal about the chick almost die because of miss it and I be like two day behind she on my miss dose and staed panic
I come off effexor to fast and be sick for a week it be horrible
also why be reluctant to effexor lithium be the most dangerous psychiatric drug out there and you be on that so why be reluctant to one as harmless as effexor
prudence lowe benjamin it be pretty safe as far as any research I have do on it for adult anywaysi be   month pregnant and my obgyn tell I the only real risk be cleft palate and a minuscule risk of a hea murmur but nothing to worry about I still do not like the idea of the risk and wean myself off as soon as possible but it be too late and my daughter have to be bear at a special hospital because she have   severe hea defect and two organ be in the wrong place I do more research on my lamictal and effexor with pregnancy effect and sure enough effexor be a lot bad than they say it be can even because pa of the babys skull and brain to be completely miss or form outside of the body it be horrible for baby but so far still seem pretty safe for adult
brenda chapman also I never say lithium do not work it be prove to be the most dangerous you disagree that be your problem and if you die of lithium toxicity due to your ignorance about the danger of it that be on you lithium work amazingly for manage my bipolar anger it work amazingly for most people but that do not mean it be woh the risk all I state be that it be the most dangerous and effexor be prove one of the least likely to give side effect you can disagree with those fact all you want but that be just ignorant
I hate effexor just finish wean off completely last month I gain a lot of weight become more agitated manic and my craving for alcohol come back I have terrible nightmare increase anxiety and have a dizzy feeling when take it bad medication I have ever try be up to mg that be just my experience
I respectfully disagree with you be comment regard both lithium and effexor lithium be the first medication I have be on that be stae to help stabilize my mood since I be diagnose   year ago effexor suck I be initially put on it for depression it make I so irritable and agitated that I turn into a rage bitch I almost lose my job as a result of it
heather morrissey I do not recommend lithium it be terribly dangerous ruin your kidney and be so terrifying to be on god forbid you be in the sun too long or do not drink enough and it can kill you it do terrible thing and I find that lamictal help just as much so I ask to be take off lithium
I have never be on lithium yet I say that because that could be nexti have be on probably over thiy different med   combination a lot have dissociative withdrawal symptom it get sooooo confuse after so long I get a hea condition with one that can be deadly but go away when you stop iti be get tired     I can not tell   so I just go to my dr and repo side affect to mental health sad someone would leave a client without a referralnot good
this be what scare I about get back on med a doctor would not just tell a diabetic to stop take their insulin I be constantly go back and foh over the struggle to find the right dosage or try to trust a dr again it be so frustrating
my god any doctor woh their degree would gradually cut you back on your med not tell you to stop completely have you stop such a high dosage of lithium so quickly be absolutely dangerous as well as just stop the effexor it be within your good interest to either go to your local er to get back on your med as soon as possible or get an appointment as quickly as possible you will crash and it will not be pretty I be not try to scare you but I have my dr do the same thing to I in   and I end up in a psychiatric hospital after a suicide attempt if I can help you or anyone else from ever go through what I didplease take this advice and the advice of everyone else who have post a response good luck
  stop sign realize that be your anxiety that be give you the hit the fan feeling and out of body type thing be call disassociative sp disorder both be to be expect as well as nausea and appetite change possibly dizzy and lightheaded   find another doctor fast if you have to go to a clinic like red rock or noh care even dhs should have some resource for you to help speed thing up   smoke some pot I be sure I be go to come under fire for this but it do help with the agitation and anxiety   not so much the depression but it do not sound like you have that at the moment    please take care   if you need to get to a hospital for a couple day please do not wait   I hope this help you and other have great idea as well   we be all here for you
chanel charand not to be argumentative as I be sure lithium withdrawal play a role in disassociation but it be not solely due to lithium withdrawal this be an issue I have deal with since before begin lithium and it be usually when my anxiety be at it be peak I have definitely notice it happen easy now of I forget my med now that my body be accustomed to get lithium and effexor and other med on a regular basis lessening the anxiety do have the potential to help lessen dissociative spell this be just I speak on my personal experience as we be all obviously very different and react differently to medswithdrawalsituation smoking pot would help the anxiety and probably the nausea as well while the person get their med back into their system and get level out also I totally agree about how quickly the lithium withdrawal can happen if your med schedule get off due to be sick or run out of med it can mess you up in a heabeat this poor person be probably hang by a thread right now due to how the med be stop
the weed do help I be not say sit around all day and smoke but just to ease the anxiety
if you need to go for a   hour eval they can get you a new doctor horrible that you be leave like that happen to I if you need to go to your primary care doctor that be who help when my doc bail then find new doc
where I live there be a   month to a year waiting list to even see if the psychiatrist be take in patient with bipolar my gp be totally useless when it come to thing like mental health but I guess I could go in to the emergency and wait hrswhich just steam my anxiety thank for all the wonderful comment and advise sure be get sick of this almost mind game for patient who need treatment immediately
I believe it   I have have so many shitty psychiatrist in the last twenty year   in fact my last one who be really old okay tell I on a wednesday that he be retire he be horrible anyway the most he ever see I for be exactly eight minute on friday morning news there he be in orange be lead into a couroomget thisfor child pornography   good doc huh
yes especially now I   make myself get out of the house for a bit to keep from have panic attack or bad
often I know I irritate my folk here most of the time
try to remember when make your appointment that you be not commit to take anything just by make the appointment you will have time to talk with the prescribing doctor about some of your fear and feeling   only after discuss these thing will you need to decide if this be the right route for you most likely med will not be the only recommendation some form of therapy group or individual will be helpful with modify your thought process about the good way to take care of you maybe your boyfriend can go with you to help with that conversation then if you decide to take medication please be patient it take some time to figure out if it be the right one or combo for you I will say that med have save my life in the past I still get cranky sometimes about have to take med and I get cranky that I still have to work with therapist or group for my paicular illness why can not it just be one or the other but these effos far outweigh how lousy I feel when my illness be in charge of I I hope this help you good of luck in your journey be well

I be rapid cycle bipolar   and have be diagnose in   yes it have be a rollercoaster but it be a manageable illness if that give you hope I continue to struggle when I take my med I resent it but I know that I need to in order to remain stable and live a balanced life you can either choose to be healthy or remain a victim to your mood which trust I be not fun and dangerous take that first step and find a doctor you be comfoable with and talk to a therapist about your feeling with this new diagnosis you will be fine and that be the great news good luck and feel free to message I with any question or concern
I be so scared to see my new pschy doc I cry when he walk into the room he be so nice   comfoing he spend a lot of time answer all my question   I write down all my question on a sheet   give it to he then he go through they one by one   now I love my monthly appointment   my husband always come in with I   good luck
do not be afraid of your diagnosis be happy you have get one and can now begin to understand your mood and how to manage they this be the beginning of something well for you
I really struggle with the idea that I would have to take med for the rest of my life to be normal it be   year since my diagnosis and I still do sometimes remember that you do not suddenly have bipolar this be not something new it be just that now you have a name for it the med be not so much about normality after all everyone be a little strange instead think of it as allow you to function so you can be the good version of you I could wander around without my glass despite be very sho sight it be possible but would make my life so much more difficult instead I wear my glass and I will have to wear they for the rest of my life this be not really any different
anxiety can cause we to put off make appointment I have find if I make a plan the day ahead and have the number ready it help for I plan everything ahead ease my anxiety
I have bipolar and anxiety   year and as of past   month anxiety have be super bad try to find a new dr appointment can cause you to stress or upset you but in the end the only way you be go to get well be with help from a dr appointment be not always fun but they usually end up be painless and you will realize you get work up over nothing
I lose my fianc to overdose last august he die in my arm I understand what you be feel that unende pain the thought that creep in when you be at your weak the crippling anxiety of have to deal with anyone or anything I go to therapy sometimes x a week and sometimes once a month I be on medication and that help keep I from self harm and help stabilize my mood the good advice I can give be to think that even in your darkest hour you be love one would want you to live live for they I have recently be able to smile instead of cry when I think of my fianc I know you do not want to hear it but time take time this be go to hu for a very long time before it get well some day you be go to want to call it quit in those time change your surrounding go for a walk a drive or even sir in your backyard I use to sit in a daze in my backyard stare at the star to calm myself down keep take your med go see a therapist and most of all hang in there there be always a well tomorrow if we can just hang in there feel free to message I if you ever want to talkredhea
thank you for share about your struggle I be sorry you lose someone so dear to you I be on epival mg for a long time it help stabilize my mood but I find it leave I feel depress a lot I find that I need an antidepressant as well everyone be different and it can take a lot of time and try different medication combo it be really hard to stay patient and hopeful while go thru it talk with your doctor be open and honest about what you be deal withabove all do not give up no matter what you can treat this and find your groove all the good
I be married to a toxic person it be so hard listen to complaint about my sleep or be lazy constantly bring up a friendship I have that make I feel good but he hate call I name time I when I leave I be not allow to go out with anyone it be a horrible life to live
one thing I will say because no one else seem to have the ability to say itwhat we see in other be sometimes how we view ourselves past or present they be mirror image of who we be at one time or who we feel we might sta to become and if we do not allow ourselves to look for anything good in someone we will only see the bad how we allow other to affect we be on we and our own conscience most time what people say to we we may see as a slam against we and we feel guilty which be why we react to it as we do but if we look deep within ourselves we will maybe see a little truth to it and no one seem to be able to handle view themselves as the bad person it do not mean we should give up and lose ourselves deeply into darkness it simply mean we should search fuher into ourselves and find a way to become a well person no one be perfect not one person we all have flaw but take to hea what other say to we may either be who we really be or who they really be argue with people or claim you be more righteous than they be leave hu feeling and damage ego you can not help fix a situation by yourself but you can not expect other to do all the work either no one should bow down to each other but it do not hu to discuss feeling in a calm and love manner either anger yell and screaming get we no where with each other
let I try this again you must come first it would easier say then do but you be sanity be more impoant if you dwell on this you will bring you be self down and I know you do not want that to happen take care and I wish you the good I have be there
est for you you need to b first you can not worry or change they
sometimes we need to just be leave alone for a minute and that be ok and sometimes we can be misinterpret good intention and helpful word either way I think if you feel overwhelmed then its a good time to take a step back from everyone altimtly they be your family and they do love you I can write a book on family drama I have be tell as much lol sometimes they do not kno how to love we in the way we need it so like I say take youime off but do not cut they off completely my advice
med be half of it a person must do the work to get well I have be suffer from mental illness for more than half my life now and I can tell you I be where she be at it will be uncomfoable but to get well you have to do what it take I go to counswling and a counselor that could problem solve not just listen to I be a victim of the world I learn everything I could and be still learn about my mental illness I have learn how to cope some day be still hard but I want to be a productive member of society so I do what it take yes I be on med and yes they help never give up
I have   kid five step all severely traumatize by life with momstepdad I watch two slip into addiction it be very bad with one she just would not get help we try everything over and over again until they be ready to take their med and go to their appointment and do the work we can not carry they it be heabreake but good ending now she be   year clean do great in college on med stable she have to want it just be there for she and push she in the right direction if she be ever a risk to herself do everything in your power that be what finally motivate my girl to move forward for herself if she be still a teen you can force she to take med and do appointment but after that it be on they good luck
for I med be a merrygoround   it can take a long timeyear even to find the right combo   in my state wa mental health diagnosis be enough to get you on the state medicaid program aka obamacare and dshs I look at med and mental illness like type    diabete the pill initially help get it under control then you focus on a healthy diet and exercise as pa of your management plan in addition to your regular check up   you can eventually go off the diabetes med if you get your condition under control for I that translate into good sleep hygiene super impoant mood swing trigger a reduction in inflammatory food abstain from alcohol   proper vitamin level check via blood test by my doctor know to be link to depression and mental illness deficiency in vitamin d b vitamin etc some so of exercise like walk or recumbent bike where you can zone out and practice positive self mantra I be woh this effo I be not my illness and my illness do not define who I be and intensive therapycounseling xwk which eventually became need only xmo learn how to handle stress and life event that can trigger an episode   I go from rapid cycling to practically stable and medication free take I the well pa of yrs I struggle all through my childhood know something be wrong with I since I be   until I hit   and decide to take control of my life because I could not keep go the way I have be live   I struggle all through my s with a wrong diagnosis of depression and insomnia and improper med   thing change when I get the right diagnosis another thing to keep in mind bipolar and other mental health disorder usually have comorbid disorder and component that may not appear until later in life or be hide by the primary and initial diagnosis
take her phone away I know that sound extreme but without it to distract she she will get bored and sta do thing like look for a job make a role if she be go to live with you that she have to take med lastly do not enable she my parent do all   and though I be really upset at first it help in the long run maybe consider yoga or meditation I can understand her position as I have bipolar and really struggle and still do sometimes to be adult ultimately it be go to come down to she will if she want well thing in her life than you have to put in work or go the lazy way and put she on disability just do not cave and not do anything
well I be in the fight formylife buti struggle w take med since I feel its notmagicandgoingtofixmeiwas notborn w those med in my blood andbodyso I struggle w mans idea of medical medicine to fix meido notevenlike givingmychildren tylenol because of thewayitmake they seem sohighntiredit change there naturally stateon the otherhand I take street drug currently meth to cope w mypain and struggle so what do I know I be uneducated and society would deem I an outcast or disposableso personally my advice islet hermake thechoiceit be her brain and chemistry just be there when she need you do not force love
carrie the motivation issue be something I still struggle with from time to time   at   I just want to be leave alone to do my own thing which be not healthy for I at all   thank goodness my parent be proactive about push I to do thing and that my doctor be amazing in help I work through thing it may not be what you want to do but some tough love may be in order here   if your son can get a jump sta to his motivation it may spur he onward with thing   he do have to have the want to get well and do what it take though   I would suggest that you talk to his doctor and maybe even a counselor to get some idea on how to help your son   they should be able to give you suppo along the way as well since you have probably get a difficult road ahead of you   mental illness be not very kind to begin with and add teenage hormone to the mix make it that much more difficult

I take buspar for gad lithium for mania and latuda for depression this be the right combo for I I feel amazing finally after   year I find the correct combination I have bipolar   gad and social anxiety disorder
I have trmd with severe anxiety my dr have I on busporin for quite a while mg   time a day   it actually work okay for a fair period I have to say in all the time that I take busporin when it be work   it be just fine for I anyone on here have any more information on fetzima I post a question about this before   and someone be kind enough to put their experience as a reply   be just wonder if anyone else have any input on it
actually I really appreciate you ask valeda basically I be prescribe a medication which if it work the effect only last a limited amount of time this time limit can be as sho as a month or as long as    but never usually more than that amount of duration I have be on so many different medication that my dr be basically run out of thing to prescribe in my last few session he have suggest that I should consider electric convulsive therapy   which I will not do as I have do a fair amount of research and feel that the risk brain injury from this type of therapy be not something I be willing to risk for myself
buspar or busperin be a nonaddictive alternative to more traditional med like valium or klonopin I have be on it off and on for a couple of year it be be very effective in treat my gad but it stop work if you take it very consecutively it be not an antidepressant it be make specifically for people with anxiety disorder it should not because mania or exacerbate it in any way at most you will feel a little dizzy if this occur then take a half of one instead of a whole one
great post I be currently wean off remeron on to effexor and be scared   but I be follow all the dr say
yes when end one med you have to be weene off and not take any at all be soo soo soo dangerous and scary I will be the first to admit that there be no miracle pill and its not just about take the right med you be your good advocate to get well but we be sick and need the med too
you make a very good point it have actually be concern I for quite some time I usually recommend chat to their dr different med c work differently with different people and can cause different side effect I have bipolar I and anxiety and it take I   mth this time around to find the right combo but I be do well and work a full time job I also have chronic pain which effect my mental health but a tweek in my dose and I be do well
uhyeahso sprinkle it with adhd anxiety   ptsdand its like skittle in the braintaste the rainbow
what be a study confuse
have my alarm clock set on my telephone to take my med
I struggle for about   year with the idea of have to take med for the rest of my life so I would take they for a few month and once I feel normal I would wean myself off they so I could be normal every single time within   or   month I would end   up in the hospital for one self harm situation or another even after that I would not take the med and would end up in a long term rehab within   year as a result of try to self medicate with a barrage of different substance buy into the hype of anti medication or jump on the band wagon of anti big time pharmaceutical but I have be take my prescribed medication daily as prescribe by my doctor and have not be hospitalize or take street drug   obsessive amount of alcohol since when I try to be normal by avoid my medication I end up act abnormal now that I be stay on my medication I live the most normal life I have ever live before just sayn
ginger right it be a struggle but my experience have be that it be a lot hard to fight the daily trouble outside of my control without the medication medication be not a cure all but once I decide to stop listen to that internal demotivational tape that have always play repeatedly in my head about how weak I be that I to need medication or how society be right about how I be foolish to think I need medication then I staed to realize that these med improve my quality of life and more impoant than that it improve the quality of life for my wife and four child do not let the thought that have always try to destroy you keep you from do something that help you live
austin I have be work with my doctor and it take almost a year and a half of try to figure out what work well with my chemical make up because everybody be different and the same regiment that work for I might not work for you we have find that a mood stabilizer daily and a stimulate when need help I to manage my daily life without fall into an emotional pit of despair while we be try to figure out what work well for I we try a medication that cause visual hallucination but I contact he and he imminently discontinue that medication and get I in the same week to make sure I be alright it be impoant to note that although that be not a pleasant experience I do not give up hope because I remind myself that the goal be to get well and only rarely when try to figure out the good way to do something be it ever get right on the first try even when I stae take the medication that I be use today I have to deal with stomach discomfo constipation   weight gain but I counter act those side effect by change my diet and force myself to sta exercise a funny thing about that be that I stae take a natural probiotic extremely healthy and all natural supplement to help with the constipation and for the first week I feel like I have to use the restroom all the time even when I do not have any stool to dispose of one thing to keep in mind be the fact that you be go to feel different but that be the point some side effect can be a sign that you be on the wrong medication but other side effect can be manageable as long as you be willing to put in the work I have be work with my doctor and for the past five year I have be on a regiment that help I and have not have to suffer any of the side effect that come with not take the medication such as hospitalization   self harm   suicidal thought I hope that answer your question and sorry if it be a bit long wind but I be work on a book at the moment so I get into writing and it be difficult to stop
I be look at get all medication regularly myself after go back and foh on it how many year straight have you be take it christopher and have you have any major side effect that be a problem that be one thing that I worry about
I get stephen johnson syndrome   horrible
I be allergic not just a little allergic but the life threaten allergy they warn you about I get stephen johnson syndrome so my exposure be very sho
I have not have problem with it it do so much help with ocd be the main thing but also with anxiety and lot of other that I do not remember right now
be take a high dose   have night terror   sweat for   month bad   mth of my life   my psychiatrist say it be not lamical but against his opinion I decrease by mg   its fine
the rash be the main thing I get it but be also lower off epilim while stae lamactil which should not be mix a while down the track   I be back on lamactillamotrogine and no rash just make sure they go very slow in raise dose it help my mood   I be bp the irritability and swing but I also take zoloft for depressioni find for I it be one that do not stack on the weight I be now on mg   night and   morning
I get seroquel after that and it work wonder should have get it first maybe it be scary   
word in my case fatigue insomnia guilt the hard to handle and judgementbut not other my own
my daughter stae on fepakote at age   she do ok but when she staed lithium thing change for the well even she recognize the change and get upset if a dr want to take she off lithium   everyone and every md be different
the depakote be most likely to help it be a mood stabilizer which be the hallmark of treatment for initial treatment for bipolar fluoxetine be an antidepressant base on my knowledge and experience I believe that antidepressant should not typically be prescribe for bipolar because it put you at a high risk of develop mania
every one do different on the drug but the main thing be do not be afraid of they   keep a journal when you sta your med to keep track of the side effect it might take a month to sta see positive result but do not stop take they I have be on med for   year and we finally have a combination that work well for I   and yes get blood work do my doctor have I mine check every   month for tegretol level
depakote a weight gainer but there be med to counteract that but do not be alarm unless you be already overweight alot
can not speak for the first two   but the last   matrazipine quiet the mind and make you sleepy and more relaxed have help I sleep without anxiety mostly
my weight gain be minimal to the point of non mentionable but the breast change be awful lead to a serious breast infection and cancer scare   otherwise though it be a great fit drug wise
I have literally be on every single mood stabilizer on the market I gain weight with all of they some more than other   and it be not just serotonin and appetite they mess up your metabolism so even if you eat healthy and limit calorie intake it will still make you gain weight they be right every med have a different effect on different people some people even claim to have lose weight but I agree weight gain be definitely not insignificant it be a huge thing and it affect your mood your depression your anxiety and mostly your self woh and really self woh be a pa of all the other ps I gain a ton of weight on risperadal
I have be on a low dose at time and so be my son in I it cause a small increase in appetite and a few pound of weight gain not even five in he in hugely increase his appetite and they change his med but the benefit of have mood and anger   irritability control woh it I do recommend get your prolactin level check if you be on it any real length of time it can cause they to rise result in those side effect other discuss
I would rather deal with irritability than gain more weight I be already deal with metabolic issue relate to hashimoto that have cause weight gain gain weight will not help my irritability or mood of that I can assure anyone who think weight gain be an insignificant side effect
this   I have literally be on every single mood stabilizer on the market I gain weight with all of they some more than other   and it be not just serotonin and appetite they mess up your metabolism so even if you eat healthy and limit calorie intake it will still make you gain weight they be right every med have a different effect on different people some people even claim to have lose weight but I agree weight gain be definitely not insignificant it be a huge thing and it affect your mood your depression your anxiety and mostly your self woh and really self woh be a pa of all the other
I do not know about weight gain but I be highly allergic slur my speech and raise my mania and anxiety so high I have to go back to the hospital more than once because it take so long to get out of my system and make I so difficult to be around
doc have try hard for so many year finally settle on anti anxiety and sedative now I be a zombie
I feel for all of you I have have separation anxiety depression and bipolar ii since I be very young of course face in the late s s and early s drs be just figure out what depression be I have be on every medication that they have come up with I have a fairly good luck with lexapro I have major panic attack often I   now on mg of trintelex I do a lot of sleep hypnosis have not be able to work and for some reason I can get ss disability
I switch from seraline to citalopram the transition be a low but I be begin to feel a change I be on   mg of seraline daily and still feel anxious
  mg be usually stae dose def talk w dr go to psychiatrist not family dr also try to find dr who be update on new research on bipolar spectrum the late diagnosis in new dsm be major depression w mixed episode which mean mood swing basically impoant cuz lot of people get diagnose w depressionanxiety for yrs before a dr see that its really a mood disorder which medicstion be different that just an anti depressant usually a mood stabilizer be add and work wonder   but if this be first time on med you prob on way too low dose of zoloft
ya it happen I sometimes need to take sleeping pill or anxiety reliever bt now I ve be take it continuously for a month and nobody know about it
I totally know what you mean the guilt you have after snap at someone be awful just know it be not your fault I have recently be diagnose with bipolar and I be on g of lamotragine citrolapram and valium use only as a back up med just in case I go up or down to control my mania and depression so far so good we be all not alone here in our battle x
I recently have a bad episode and have a date I think I be ok with he but the day I be upset and cry and he say I lead he on so yes I do know how much it hushe tell I he be councillor so feel safe with he so now I be think I be a very judge of characterit be mad how you feel afterwardsyou feel awful

hi there I have be on they for depression there an ok tablet not on anything at the moment   it help I to keep stress out of my life x
I think have bipolar you actually have to go through those up and down different med therapy and sometimes even inpatient treatment   it be a struggle that will never disappear but what help I the most be faith in god and positive thinking someone tell I to find what make I happy and pursue it   I be still strugglingeven give up on god lose relationship isolate myself to the point of have social anxiety afraid of people I just put on a mask and fight the day ahead with positive thinkingsome day be good and some day be bad but I thank god I make it through spread love and courage to you  
fluoxetine work great for my depression but make my anxiety bad send prayer and love
please talk honestly with your doc about your anxiety I be on   mg of fluoxetine also and it be the level I need but my friend I think you need a bit high dose also please seek counseling talk to an objective professional be extremely helpful   there be professional to help you seek help you be woh it
be you see a dr on a regular basis you need to open   honest with the dr   tell they how much you be struggle you could also ask about counselling service that might be available to you so you can work on some strategy to help you feel more in control blessing

you might try klonopin instead of valium it last long might help you make it through the night and I have so much anxiety and then you will feel a little more refreshed
latuda make I question life and give I incredible anxiety try topamax but hate the side effect I be bipolar   so I think I be want to try a single medicine therapy I have be read on it and I would love to just take seroquel at night
yep I have get klonopin clonazepam lamictal and cymbalta on board but actually go to the doctor today as depressionanxiety have get bad lately   jill jorgensen I be wonder if bipolar and bpd could coexist I know it yay for we   we get both   though I have bipolar type   my good to everyone you be not alone
my hea break for you send you love light and healing from south africa I be also live a nightmare with severe depression and anxiety an the lack of understanding and empathy by those around I never cease to shock mehow I wish I be terminally ill then I would know my hell would end soon
I be not sure what you mean by sleep anxiety but   I have awful insomnia from anxiety and on the rare occasion I get some sleep I have wake up because of anxiety I wake up with awful chest pain and racing thought I would say anxiety can def wake you up also I know med work different for everyone but personally wellbutrin give I horrific anxiety so if your anxiety get bad after stae wellbutrin you might want to talk to your dr about that
yep welbutrin be an anxiety producer for I too I have be thru so many med change and trial it would make your head spin or mine lol hang in there with the med change until they find the right one for you I be on clonazepam at night seem to keep the anxiety away and I sleep pretty well at least well than before also soft musicmeditation can be so helpful
yeah I would never have anxiety before I try wellbutrin I know all drug work differently for people and it be probably a miracle drug for some but that be the bad drug reaction I ever have and it be scary and awful
I be sorry you be feel so ill yes sleep anxiety can wake you up anxiety can really mess with sleep and can cause stomach upset try look up mindfulness there be phone app as well it be a way to help treat anxiety it help I a lot especially if I sta to flip out before bed it be a way of focus on the present and leave anxiety behind all the good
sadly this happen all too often I only have   people I can depend on   of those be family member unfounately this disorder bring we to be more attached and love deeply than the other person possibly could this lead to half heaed friendship not to mention that some people be unable to handle the constant mood swing and stress it cause this be the sad truth we be different and we be not normal in the eye of society but we be still beautiful we be still useful and we still deserve love you will have only a few who can even try to comprehend only a few who can handle you at your bad and love you still the pain of lose friend and not understanding be so painful but I want you to know that even if you just have one person that be something that some people do not even have if she want to cut tie let she you deserve friend who will not drop you for a boy or because they be too busy
some people though they seem like forever friend really be not they be just those one who sadly pass through our life I be horrible at keep in contact with long distance friend most of the time because I rarely reach out on my own but if someone message or I manage to call someone we talk for age life get hectic but if she will not contact you back then she be not woh it you already do the easy pa I understand the fear of abandonment I have severe abandonment and sometimes it be hard to really understand that very few people be an actual constant in your life I rely on animal and my immediate family for consistency
easier say then do but it be alot less struggle to just let it go then to try and carry the torch which may never be relit try to get a solid network of friend and maybe at time ponder what could have be but try to live in that past be a dangerous blanket so familiar yet so cold move forward be what life be experience moment and those who stay til the end so keep your head up and stop blame yourself as if your the one who cause the separation and try to look at it for what it be two people grow apa and no amount of tape can change what it be
your not alone my friend have move away even really really good friend and I barely hear from they you sound a bit like I fear abandonment I have my blend family which offer enough stress and work and pretty much no friend I be tired of be the one try to maintain contact it be sad but do not really have friend the last couple I lose be not real friend in the end
cindy muhlenburg border it be a struggle to get off the seroquel but once the doctor get thing change for I I really sleep much well plus I stop drink soda and eat junk food talk to your doctor that be the good thing to do   good luck
I be scared to try new med
I should add that I have chronic pain from degenitive disc disease   I have titanium in cc   I have   chronic migraine as well as due to a seizure no left collarbone so exercise be hard for I that be why I be do water therapy   it be so hard for I to stay active as it really give I anxiety to be around people
I have bipolar   and take effexor and wellbutrin in am and   mg neurontin gabapentin    mg clonazepam at night   have not be a problem at all   I have an anxiety disorder as well never be on seroquel or remeron but do take saphris at night for a while which be great for sleep but do gain weight and have to quit because I could not afford it also still have leave over weight gain from a trial of lithium that just make I too sluggish hope this help
very helpful I take wellbutrin for year but it cause I to have grand mal seizure during   I break my collarbone   and it   never heal and have to be remove   I also have anxiety and take xanax as need
when it be just   pound I accept it but now that it be   lbs I think it be unacceptable my primary dr be upset he say he give remeron to his patient that need to gain weight he also say I could become diabetic so frustrated
I really get irritated yesterday when someone post in summation that weight gain be a small price to pay for mental health ummmm no   if say weight gain worsens depression and anxiety then it be not a small price to pay we have enough problem without have to fight a battle against the scale
I be on   mg of neurotin at bedtime for a total of   mg per day   seroquel be the guilty pay in weight gain   I use to be on   mg each eve   gain as much weight as you   no matter what I do it be impossible to lose   I have try exercise and different diet I don t eat a lot except this med cause I to crave carb at night
no but effexor make I gain a ton of weight and go off it suck horribly
shy nielsen
I think your true statement be waste on   of the reader   I have watch the struggle of very responsible precious one and be so proud of they and so bless by they
ok first of all marae corday   there be no snapping out of anything no more than snap out of schizophrenia my husband suffer from this disorder and it can be devastating and no one with this disease choose to be this way second of all just because someone have bipolar disorder do not mean they be stupid or incapable of be independent or self reliable that all depend on the severity of their disease and their individual progress with treatment there be actually a great deal of very intelligent and successful people include celebrity who suffer from bipolar their be no doubt that someone with bipolar must have a strong network of family and friend to be suppoive and help they when they need it but let I assure you that mental illness be in no way a first world problem as you like to call it mental illness stretch beyond all social class race culture religion etc I can assure you it be very much a global problem the only difference between our first world and other third world country be the attitude and acceptance of which we acknowledge and treat mental illness here for example most americans have compassion and acceptance of mental illness without blame the person who suffer while a small number of douchebag such as yourself have no understanding or sympathy of anyone else pain except your own and just expect people to snap out of something they can not control let I tell you one thing right now there have always be a disgusting stigma associate with mental illness that it be somehow bull shit or can be prevent or avoid which be fuher perpetuate by people like you but there be absolutely no difference between mental illness and any other physical disease such as cancer or diabete it be a physical chemicalhormonal imbalance of the brain would you tell someone with cancer or diabetes to snap out of it if you can not educate yourself on such matter and have an enlightened and intelligent point of view on such matter then it would probably be more beneficial for you to refrain from comment your idiocy because it reflect poorly on your character and make you look like a horse ass
melissa hobson I doubt you would be bother to read this but
be bipolar and have bipolar disorder be two different thing everyone be case be different there be a point I legitimately could not work for eight month try to find the right mess struggle with bad side effect or have bad episode in the middle of work I never get help from the government but that be each person decision to make when I get well it be not just easy to get back into the swing of thing because of my personality it be always hard keep a job people do not appeal to my personality no I could not snap out of it to take care of myself my family help I if I do not have my family it could have go a lot bad and not everyone have a suppo system
marae corday the system be overwhelmed because it be chronically and terribly underresource have be for a long time your selfstigma and community stigma of mental health be pa of the problem we need to be pa of the solution   wake up
I will try I say most yes some be so affect by this that they can not function and they become homeless but what be the solution we have any overwhelmed ss system   I be diagnose bipolar I work because I have a family and myself to take care of but I feel overwhelmed so much at work I often feel it would be well to be dead
bipolar disorder be a spectrum mood disorder there be type i ii and cyclothymic which be a less severe classification between I and ii with type I the cycle be long and you experience more episode of mania type ii which be what I have you experience what be call hypomania a less severe form of type type be mania you may be irritable snappy productive and goal orient but with a sho temper the cycle for type ii be shoer and more frequent cyclothymia be when you have frequent cycle between be low but not suicidally depressed and hypomanic you operate close to baseline but you have frequent episode between depression and hypomania type ii however be where you have cycle between hypomania and extreme suicidal depression type I can be difficult and dangerous because of the impulsive and reckless behavior associate with mania but type ii send you into frequent state of suicidal ideation   the good news however be that both be manageable with medication and a good psychotherapist
I have not be diagnose with a stage yet I be manic for long period than I be down but drop fast and hard I get suicidal ideation I use to act on it when young twice but be savedluckily I have learn to cope but it be a daily struggle
type   can also be manic and depressive at the same time that be when I honestly feel like I be go crazy and I truly need to watch my suicidal thought   if I have the studys link I would post it but for every manic episode in a type   there be around   depressive episode for type   that ratio become   type   manic be also more in the normal range than a type s   both type be horrible though I do not wish they on anyone unfounately my son have it too and be rapid cycling like I be
  be not bad they be both equally difficult in different way with   the cycle be long and you experience more episode of mania type   which be what I have you experience what be call hypomania a less severe form of type s mania you may be irritable snappy productive and goal orient but with a sho temper the cycle with type   be more frequent than type   what be dangerous about type   however be the extreme suicidal depression type   can be difficult and dangerous because of the impulsive and reckless behavior associate with mania but type   send you into frequent state of suicidal ideation so no type   be in no way less difficult than type   the good news however be that both be manageable with medication and a good psychotherapist
I try to enjoy each day I embrace the high day but I dread the day that I begin to feel bad because I know the first day of down be the good day and it be go to get way bad before I sta to level out
I be trouble I have this friend   year since we first meet and he do not know anything about my issue he be such a great friend it be like have another brother at one point he come to visit so my niece have issue and she once tell he how she suffer so I make mention one day of a situation she be in then say to he I feel so sorry for her family because she be a constant embarrassment to they then I say you be lucky you do not have any one you know who have mental illness he look at I and say oh god no if I find out they do I could not cope with that so for that reason and even though he be a wonderful friend I do not tell he and most likely never will sigh in my life I have two nervous breakdown and he do come with my mum to visit I in the hospital but the way he react to my comment that day I be not sure if tell he about my issue be the right thing for I to do   
there be a gene for anxiety namely slca
it take I a long time to find the right combination of med but have finally find one that work and have be on it for a few year now and it do surprise you and even scare you when thing finally sta to even out I get the fear of the inevitable crash but try to be positive because that crash be not guarantee
I have be tell when I be deal with stress I have to try with some cope mechanism it be easy for someone who have a normal brain but for we it be try to tell a deaf person they should try to listen
I hate take med the flip flop of bipolar disorder be    horrible I have get    well with handle it but sometimes it still get I
I must say I be control bipolar but I always have my up and down still and yes I love the happy pa but there be thing that make you happy when your stable and not necessarily the mental pa of it just try not to dread that you be go to come down eventually and be prepare for it
maybe your just stae to recognise some of your red flag as I like to call they subtle sign your mood be shift i d say use they as a positiveput bank card in someone else hand do not buy alcohol avoid people and place your high will feed off they will not always be sign of impede change but if your not sure good to be safe it be a good thing your do great get to know your disorder that be all your maybe get well and stae to notice more enjoy all the good day yes the bad will be back but next time you will be ready
I be kind of the opposite I guess I go along day to day and do my thing and its not all shine and rainbow but its not ahorrible hurricane either so I be ok I can deal then come a bad day usually trigger by my physical illness and the bottom fall out and everything be not just bad but not go to well and then I sta ti wonder if I be just fake the happiness and   good time I wonder if I be take the say fake it till you make it to literal sigh
hi fiona do not go off your med until you explore other option I can not tolerate side effect of lithium I can not walk because of ataxia or any antidepressent because I get an immediate manic swith also can not take any antipsychotic because I get dystonia or akithesia take I   year to get my med right   and the weight be come off I understand your concern as I put on   kgs so I have be change to the epilepsy med for mood stabilisation sodium valproate and lamictal as well as an anti parkinson drug simiplex I use to have sleep tab zopiclone and for spike anxiety   valium prn now stable and in a very good place no more sleeper or vlium need I be out and about walking   lose   kilo apparently sodium valproate and lamictal be now first medication use for bipolar in uk befor lithium and antidepressant combo I have bipolar   diagnose    now   year old and use to suffer long period of manic psychosis so hang in there and work with your dr to find the right med I never think I would find the stability and peace I have nond all the good
so just an update to those who want it   I see the doctor she be so unhelpful it be not even funny say that I should have go to my gp with the pain and other symptom after get upset with she she admit that I could be experience toxicity but refuse to give I any test say that I must stop the lithium and if I be not well by monday I must go to my gp and ask for test I demand to be put back on my old mood stabilizer until I have see my neuro to get well help with my seizure she insist upon give I an anti depressant which I have be tell numerous time that I can not have and tell I I must come back in   week unless the anti depressant make I manic then I must come back soon I be grossly unhappy with the way thing go down today but I be live in hope wait to see my neuro in hope that I can qualify for ect or the surgery for epilepsy thank to everyone for their suppo
first you be never beyond help second I have be on lithium for year and year and my first year of be on it be horrible but it do get well and then you learn that your body need it and you feel good about take it and it really help just make sure you get your blood check every three month it will get well stick with it
I use to be on lithium   I be thirsty all the time and put on weight   when they get I on the right dose   I feel the wellest I have ever be   it be a shame I have to come off it as I have be diagnose as a type   diabetic and be no long allow to take the lithium   I now take lamotrogine and I be ok on it but not as good as I be on lithium
I go from   mg to   mg of lithium in addition to some other med I find that lithium destroy my stomach and even make it to where I could not leave the house for a few hour follow take my med out of fear of not have a bathroom   I have since figure out that I have to eat when I take it I find that it can not be a sugary snack but like actual food I also eliminate regular soda and that help as well   the big thing I have to watch for be getting dehydrate I can feel how much different it affect I while on lithium and when I have an issue I reach for something like pedialyte to help het a jump on balance thing out
it make I completely nuts    I have to go off after a few week because I be paranoid and see thing
lithium make I a zombie when I take it   but to let you know you be not beyond help   there be other medication that help have you try lamical   it have calm my nerve down more than my klonopin   it be for mood swing but it help for anxiety too   ask your doctor to give you a drug test that pinpoint what medication you can and can not take   that will help with what be out there   it be only   and it will determine what you need   do not ever let anyone tell you that you be beyond help   there be a lot of good in you and it bring you down to here that   even if you have another dr   do not get discourage   also try therapy will help too   it will make you feel more relieved to know an unbiased person can talk to you and bring your anxiety down   I hope this help   good luck
I have uncontrollable tic and tremor so bad with lithium I could not go out in public sometimes I take latuda now it be a last reso for I as I have literally try everything else good luck
I see my therapist todaywho work closely with my doctor she say I look dreadful and be in tear from pain throughout most of our session she have get the nurse to book I for a doctor visit on friday to see what be up the nurse agree that   day with increasingly bad stomach pain cramp nausea etc be not woh it something be definitely wrong they be worried about my kidney at this stage especially since I be already a high risk patient with decrease liver function so it be just to wait it out till friday morning thank all for your suppo and help this community be amazing
my sibling be on lithium and it severely damage her kidney and create other issue for her scary stuff
I would be concern that if you be high risk you be reactive to it in a different way than other be honestly I be obviously not a dr but since you just stae the medication it be probably safe for you to stop take it rather than stay on it until friday
everyday struggle
it be not like I be hide my personality but when you carry social phobia borderline and other you do not really have any personality leave the illness become your personality and people do not take kindly to unpleasantness

pls talk to doc before stop med I be a size   when I be put on seraquel   be take off due to wait gain struggle to loose it for month   as the lbs slowly begin to she would I decide to stop my lithiun   mg daily I end up section myself I get out go back on both previously mention med the weight come back plus some make it up to over   lbs   have to sqeeze into size   tell my doc I feel the weight gain negatedout weigh the mental gain now I m about   mo on just lithium   ambien I try everything to slim down veggie   water sweat   tear no process sugar in the house my teen love that one accountablity paner nothing help I go through another anerexic stage not sure of correct term but I would not reccomend it now I m a snug size    scare my stupid brain will not know when to stop loose weight
I be a very unhealthy   lbs when I staed lithium and I also have thyroid issue before realize I be bipolar   I be   now after having be on the low dose of lithium but I feel human   I eat well   I be motivate to leave the house and be active more so than I have be in year   I worry about you just stop   if I be to do that it would be hell for I   I hope you find something that work   redhea
with anxiety medication and antidepressant make you gain weight   now there be a solution for that   if you get on thyroid med to help that will work   also I know it be hard but change what you be eat   like put fruit and veggie in the house and if you crave something create something good with the fruit and veggie   if you go off your medication you will experience hell   you will have up and down and you will eat because you be depress all the time   you will have withdrawal symptom and that be hard to stop   you will make yourself bad stop it   I be bipolar and I really do not suggest to stop take your med   there be some really bad side effect from it   I would lower your dose on the lithium and stay on the other   I do not want to sound rude but the last thing you should do be stop your medication   I have see what happen and I know you will not like it   for example   my dad be bipolar and my mom come from work when I be a baby and she see my crib break into piece with I still in the bed   he be off his medication for several day   now when I run out of my anxiety med for   day my jaw lock up and all I could do be shake and cry because I could not talk   my jaw be pretty much stuck   I have tmj and it flare so bad that we have to force my pharmacist to fill it   there be not any method you can do if you stop your medication   I would just be careful   and you may be on a high thinking it be ok to stop   a lot of people feel that way   you be not alone   stay safe and good luck

if you hold onto anger it just eat away your inside I never raise my voice at my wife so we have never have a fight in   year of marriage if you do not yell back at someone they soon calm down I also forgive my family and friend pretty much straight away after an argument because it be no use hold onto the anger you feel I just go on with life and the dark damage that fighting bring do not bother I at all of course I get upset but that be usually at the referee in the footy I love lol I yell at they life too sho enjoy your family and friend while you have they because one day you or they will be go
so just an update to those who want it   I see the doctor she be so unhelpful it be not even funny say that I should have go to my gp with the pain and other symptom after get upset with she she admit that I could be experience toxicity but refuse to give I any test say that I must stop the lithium and if I be not well by monday I must go to my gp and ask for test I demand to be put back on my old mood stabilizer until I have see my neuro to get well help with my seizure she insist upon give I an anti depressant which I have be tell numerous time that I can not have and tell I I must come back in   week unless the anti depressant make I manic then I must come back soon I be grossly unhappy with the way thing go down today but I be live in hope wait to see my neuro in hope that I can qualify for ect or the surgery for epilepsy thank to everyone for their suppo
hi there I only identify with drink a ton of water because I be constantly thirsty it work well for I so I see that as a minor inconvenience plus I should drink more water than I use to anyway the only big problem I have on it be when I be over my current dose as dr prescribe past mg in am and   in pm I be in such an unmotivated foggy state my advice would be that do not worry if it help but be not at the standard therapeutic dose even if your blood draw result come out that it be low and you have be steadily take it and not miss dose I be at the dosage above and have be for some time after taper down it still help immensely so in my opinion do not be afraid to tell your doc to lower dose or even see if there be something else entirely even if you have try s ton of different med I know I do not tough on all your concern but I hope this help a bit I wish someone have tell I soon that the standard therapeutic dose be what most people be on but some people be different and their dose that work for they can be different good of luck to you redhea
I be on lithium for   year it work amazingly but be a terrible drug it dehydrate you because it have high concentration of sodium in it which first off do serious damage to your kidney secondly it make you drink a lot if you get even the slight bit dehydrate on it it turn all your body organ toxic to themselves and will cause organ failure of all your organ and you can die same with if your lithium level be even the slight bit high which be why they have to do frequent bloodwork that be why there be warning to stay out of the sun at all time and drink a lot also if you ever get pregnant on lithium it be know to cause severe deformity such as miss or duplicate body pas non functional organ and organ form outside of the babys body even you can also never stop this med cold turkey or it will kill you I miss   dose in a row once   morning and a night dosetotal of mg and by pm that day everything be spin my hea be race I feel nauseous as hell and end up faint the drs confirm it be due to withdrawal of the lithium I would never recommend this drug it be the absolute most effective med I be ever on but it be so scary
I see my therapist todaywho work closely with my doctor she say I look dreadful and be in tear from pain throughout most of our session she have get the nurse to book I for a doctor visit on friday to see what be up the nurse agree that   day with increasingly bad stomach pain cramp nausea etc be not woh it something be definitely wrong they be worried about my kidney at this stage especially since I be already a high risk patient with decrease liver function so it be just to wait it out till friday morning thank all for your suppo and help this community be amazing

wow   that be fast I be in a car accident that be not my fault and I have medical documentation list all my issue depression ptsd anxiety panic disorder etc since   and still be currently under treatment and have be fire from   job and lay off but they deny I   or   time and I be currently wait for a cou date I staed apply last year for disability

I also get approve very quickly   I apply in march and have my first check in june of that year   it help that they have all my work record and medical record show the year I spend up to   month in and out of the hospital   when I go to their psychologist he talk to I for a bit and at the end of   the   minute visit he tell I not to worry he be approve I    yes on average there be a bit of a fight to get approve   but do not let fear of the fight stop you from go through the process   you never know what the outcome will be

they have to have one of their doctor verify and confirm the full extent of you be mental illness and to what degree everything appear ieslightmildacute average moderate duel purpose diagnosis severe extreme when you go to eval be completely honest no adlib no overunder   exaggerated do not leave anything to their interpretation take med as prescribe on day of eval find some self moderation exercise that actually work   use affirmation to alleviate anxiousfear relax be urself do not think about thing too much or too little if you do not understand a question ask for clarification before answer take you be time it be not good to rush this eval say a prayer to you be high power of you have one to help you stay calm cool and collect do not stress too much remember this be only one step to self reliance keep up the fight and you will succeed breakthestigmaofmentalillness
they turn every one down on your first attempt I get a lawyer the second time but I have documentation from when I be a preteen it be not easy but it be a huge relief when they validate how hard you struggle everyday
I have and be deny twice now and my mom it take almost   year for she to get hers   to qualify you have to see a dr at least once a month and the dr have to say that you unable to work for whatever reason anxiety ptsd whatever and that be the main thing because they will suggest different job that they think you will be able to do like answer the phone or filing paperwork   stuff that seem easy or manageable for they   so get a lawyer and make sure you have all your medical record especially anything stay you can not work   good luck
yeah you have to see a psychiatrist at least once a month and when you be apply for thing like this it be well to get your psychiatrist to write you a letter to give as proof as they can describe it well well for I that be easy as I struggle put emotion into word but it be hard to get take seriously they mainly consider those who also have major physical effect too so like with I   I black out alot and become unresponsive but even with that information I have still be reject
you can get one of those pay after you win lawyer so you do not have to go to cou all the time   I get super anxious about stuff like this too but keep push forward   any little bit of progress be still progress
do you know if it be require to see the psychiatrist or psycologist once a month I see my psychiatrist once every   week for med check because of my insurance but I see my therapist once to twice a month depend on the time of year and some time as often as weekly I be deny once and get anxious about see a judge so I be about to apply again
and job   that they say that you can do disqualify s you if you have one do not worry you still have another oneaee not disabled
olanzapine be the good drug to be on be you have either bipolar or schizophrenia my diagnosis be change from time to time I be definitely bipolar but at time the feature of the illness change where there be paranoid theme delusion and random voice this be call schizoaffective and it be possible to swing between both sphere I be from australia and initially olanzapine be only prescribe for schitzo disorder when I be put on olanzapine I have be the good I have ever be   most of the time only problem   be an issue be weight gain and severe munchiesif you have full blown schizophrenia you would not be able to hold down a job you would be cripple by the voice and psychosis and not be able to function well in society go with it bipolar can be great when its not out of control for motivation creativity aistic persuit and hold down a job and do it well the self harm thing have never be an issue with I but there be therapy that you can use to stop that destructive behaviour I be tell its a distraction from the pain that you may be go through I wish you all the good
my mood be level out but it be definitely not a quick fix or happy pill I still struggle a lot
I get some of my bad panic attack right before I fall asleep
except the night terror
unless I get too hot then I have disturb dream like last night   wake up disturbed
I have feel this and be wake by panic attack
it really depend on who you have help you if you have record history of issue and a good knowledgeable case worker it will be much easy I have not go on disability they offer to send it through for I but I do not want to but I use to work for a company that handle case for people on unemployment go through disability work with vocational rehab consultant and it really be surprising what get deny and what get approve that be why I stress the case worker
I be grant ssdi surprisingly quickly I fill out the paper work with a social worker provide by my mental health care clinic when I be get treatment I be diagnose with anxiety mdd and bp    just keep in mind disability be not free money it be barely enough to cover expense and you will still need other help with food housing and maybe even extra insurance to help with thing not cover by medicare which can be a lot not to mention they will routinely decide that you owe fee and will withhold some of your fund this may become a large problem with the way congress be go and can vary by state regulation
I have bipolar disorder panic and anxiety disorder borderline personality disorder paranoid personality disorder and a few more I can not remember off the top
I do not use a lawyer I just go to my local as office have they help I fill they out and they ask I over   question   when they be talk to you do not be scared to answer honestly even if it be embarrassing or whatnot because then they will think you be just fine
I be deny initially which be common unless you be mostly dead I get a lawyer and we have be work on it he be handle everything contact my drs send they questioner and collect the information we need I finally just get my hearing date in september it be be like almost   year since I appeal my dr be fully behind I and my lawyer know he do not get pay if I do not get get the disability so many time if they feel there be no chance they will not take your case at all I have a hard time talk about my mental issue but he be tell I that be not the day to to hide away and pretend it be all ok do not lie do not overdue it but be honest about your bad day what it be truly like for you you have   minute of I and the judge ask you question about your mental health please do not tell we you be ok when you be not there be also another person I guess that will be there that will be judge my answer and information and in his opinion be I able to work he have never meet I and be simply go by the hearing my lawyer and the judge will question he too then it can be a while before I get my answer about the hearing as well my psychiatrist tell I she believe I will get it and she can not believe I be not on it already she be very clear in her opinion my therapist be be grill and she be very clear about how detrimental it be for I to work I have also get spine issue   spine surgery in   year chronic migraine syndrome that actually land I in the hospital for a week last month so they be submit those file too and ask my neurologist for his input there be no point ask my oho surgeon my lawyer say oho surgeon be almost impossible to get to help with disability benefit so it can be do but it be a long frustrating road they usually will back date your payment to the original date you apply if you get a lawyer they will take a percentage of that which be a small price to pay to not have to navigate through this alone I have not hear many people win this on their own I have get bi polar   rapid cycling with psychosis ptsd anxiety and borderline personality disorder hope this help answer some of your question
be approve about   year ago for bipolar ii anxiety panic attack depression etc after be deny   year prior however have spend the last   month be review to see if I be still disabledwhich have only make my condition bad but social security continue to drag this out so even if you get approve there be no guarantee how long it will last
I have a success story   I have agoraphobia bipolar gad and panic attack   I use a company call ssdc service you can google they who do all the paperwork over the phone and mail   I be approve my first time after only four month   I suggest you call this group and see what they can do for you   good luck

I can only tell you about my experience but I also have diabete and chronic pain from migraine I have major depressive disorder ptsd and anxiety I have help from a legai aid paralegal and she be incredibly helpful I would not have be able to fill out all the paperwork without she both my physician and the psychologist I be see fill out paperwork to send in it take month to hear anything I be incredibly lucky in that I be not deny the first time and so I do not need to reapply andor see a judge most people like   have to file an appeal I know of only one other person who do not have to get an appeal and she lose two inch in height from a compressed spine I do not know but for I it might have be because I have both mental and physical issue good luck
I could not share the original post from vellum and vinyl so I copy and paste it psa no one fucking tell you this so here it be when sign out form to apply for disability   fill out a form for diagnosis you be suppose to fill it out as you on your bad day like I fill out form that say I could do most thing usually like my doctor add in the condition like yeah they can feed themselves when not stress they can do this when not stress but how I should have fill it out be more like some day I can not feed myself some day I can not leave the house my doctor do not even know this but I talk to someone who have work with people with both developmental and intellectual disability for a number of year and she tell I to write down how it be for your bad day this should be a thing they tell you but it be not pa of the reason I do not get my autism diagnosis as soon as I should have be because I fill out form wrong
I have the problem every time I have to leave my home I have dissociative disorder ptsd gad agoraphobia and major depression omg I hate leave my home it be a struggle to go but do what you have to do for your quality of life

anyone who have be live with mental health disorder be very familiar with the restless insomnia and manic episode that can take place even if you be on medication therapy and see a mental health professional   I have be in this boat many time and have find that deep breathing exercise have a cup of tea or join an   hr online suppo group to chat with people who really understand what you be go through can really help   if you be really in crisis or think about harm yourself however you should call your local community outreach or crisis hotline immediately    stay strong and just take it one day at a time   god bless you

this scare I so much   it make I want to say screw it and stay sick if I be gunna be sick anyway    aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh fml
it make I extremely irritable
I see that but as someone who be afraid of my med after read all the awful stuff make I second guess take it I be so thankful I be tell that same advice
I have be on celexa for year try other and have horrible side effect    back on celexa and deplin now add wellbutrin to pump ipmy dopamine   anybody with this regimine   result    thank
what would it look like with bipolardepression general anxiety and social anxiety very interesting
I be on xanax xr mg prior to that I take klono but do not help I I be very afraid to sta either medication but glad I finally give the xr a try finally able to have relief from anxiety and panic attack and be finally get out I have try many antidepressant but do not respond to they I do not want to be on xanax forever but for now it be help they be addict and I be sure the withdrawal be hell but what be one to do   can not live your life in hell either everyone be different talk to your doctor
I take klonopin and I have never have withdrawal when the hospital take I off of they I sometimes take more than need because I want the panic or flashback to stop but I have come off they with no trouble
I have simply push my shopping trolley aside sit down in the middle of the isle pull out my cell and spend time on facebook till I be okcrazy yes but work for I every time peep will stare and andand so what so take a pillow with you give it a bash and throw the med in the trash by the way I see a doc on the telly where professional therapist be treat patient by give they a low dose of extacy during a   hour session for   day obviously illegal but with a   success rate on anxiety and a few other mental illnessesdisorder themthem
the panic atack you if you want to go   how
easy one there be nothing you can take that will deal with anxiety attack as such you will not grow out of they diazepam do work but your well off changinf your mental well be get a cat walk a dog   music work for I junglist
I take   mg xanax a day but I really would not recommend it because it be only a temporary fix and really hard to come off of my mom be bipolar where I get it from and she smoke pot and it really help she also as melissa hutter have already mention withdrawal from benzo be pretty horrible I mean like diarrhea vomiting and flu like symptom such as body ache and fever that be the bad withdrawal though just talk to your doctor and the both of you can determine what be right for you there be nonnarcotic drug that can relieve your anxiety as well
beta blocker only block the physical symptom low dose seroquel you will be drowsy or buspirone have be show to have similar efficacy to xanax but need to be use over a number of week like an antidepressant but be not a benzo be all good choice I would only use xanax   as an extreme emergency option and use it extremely rarely as in I would keep some around and only use it when all else fail   make sure you have as many other option both medical and psychological available as well a combination of med may also be need to address my anxiety flashback and extremely minor panic attack I use mindfulness practice deep breathing propranolol mg twice a day effexor mg in the morning epilim mg twice a day miazapine mg at night and as my emergency medication for when everything else fail valium mg up to twice a day as need seroquel be also use but I use that for sleep not anxiety mg at night as need as be my prescription
I take xanax and honestly it be very helpful for I I do not do well with the energy of many people so whenever I an force to go shop I take mg and sometimes take another if the anxiety be intense I be prescribe   max per day   definitely consider it I have not notice any withdrawal as I only use it when necessary also not sure if you be on other medicine but this be combine with paxil which be take daily
I take   mg xanax   time a day be on it   year I be a recover alcoholic I want to get off it but afraid to
that be very admirable I can totally empathize some day it be not as hard to get out of the house due to that overwhelming fear but other day I will take one if my hea be race I will have to try cut they in half and see if it help the same  
I have same script   up to x   I do not use it very often and sta with only   one   I try to make myself go out no matter how small a step every day sometimes feel the fear but do it anyway   the more you stay inthe more you stay in god bless
I totally agree with michelle here   manuel   it be prescribe and ceainly a powerful drug and therefore abused quite frequently definitely follow direction carefully and never exceed the limit prescribe trust I I know from experience I once be so depressed and anxious that I take all   of my pill at once they be suppose to be spread out every   hour and end up so sleepy that I fall asleep for the entire day   I have also read that it can cause memory loss which I have not experience but definitely something to be aware of   good luck
you can use dissolvable klonipin can be use only as need for panic attack in the moment work wonder and you be not take it all the time only when need it work almost instantly when use
just do not let they talk you into take a benzo such as xanax or klonopin I have be on klonopin for ten year and the withdraw be horrible plus it should only be sho term use and now my memory be not so great thank to be on it a long time no one tell I the effect of long term use
that be what I take my psychiatrist take I off klonopin because of how bad the side effect be and what new research about it have show I be also in counseling to help with the anxiety among other thing
you can use dissolvable klonipin can be use only as need for panic attack in the moment work wonder and you be not take it all the time only when need it work almost instantly when use
how about demand more from your panic attack this teach your mind that you be not in danger and you be call it be bluff
this be one technique I be learn in counsel my anxiety get so bad that I panic just leave the house
this be a good option ask yourself what be the bad that can happen and so what if this happen until you can not produce any more issue can help you just have to make sure you do it in a safe place and have a safety plan as if you do not have practice it can lead to fuher panic
a few    breathing be breathe in for   second hold it for   second and exhale for   second that switch we back to the autonomic nervous system and calm the whole body another be a multi mineral supplement trace mineral   witjout iron ir copper and add magnesium anxiety and panic can be cause by zinc and magnesium deficiency alone sometimes niacin help I with rumination and compulsion
norine delong jarrell it do work get back in touch with your sense individually and focus on these can be a good distraction from a panic attack what have always help I be just remember this too shall pass it be all in my head deep breath   slowly in and then out and it go away eventually     take the deep breath and slow down your hea rate truly help though   
have you try meditation relax music stress ball color mandala that be what I do when I get panic attack
my good advice after be on med for   year   be totally up front with your psychiatrist do not stop take your med without your doc approval   you may have to try several or combination of   or   drug   it take at least   week to sta work   I have an addiction problem so can not take benzodiazepine xanax valium klonipen ativan etc usually use for anxiety there be other non addict   I can not drink alcohol   you should consider that as well just do not give up and the group be great I have get good advice and suppo good luck and welcome to this thing call life in our world
I feel for you it be not an easy road have you be give med   I have find out I have bipolar   year ago I have be on a multitude of med till the right combination be find therapy also help a lot I have actually be very stable but can not handle stress very well
hi debra I have issue to the one thing that really upset I be people not understand they call I lazy keep say how be it you go to bed so early every night say you feel so tired when you hardly do any physical activity I try to explain that a person can become so mentally drain stressed and other thing that it wear they out physically and that be why we get so tired but they still do not understand vikki tempest
jennifer wilson it be not exactly pointless for I I walk out with my soul more intact than it be when I go in but apparently it be stressor relate not medication
jennifer my son be on abilify and insist it be not help after a discussion with his psychiatrist he be take off abilify all together and put on depekote he be also put on lexaprosp for his depression and xanax for the anxiety talk to your dr it be seem to be all trial and error my son be diagnose in february and have have several med change already this combination seem to be workingfinger cross good luck to you sweetiegod bless
oh my goodness I be change on to fluoxetine and victran I think that be how they be spell I have the bad nightmare dreadful sleep at night I would be up   time a night put washing on hang it to dry and go to the loo   I then drive to a place minute from home and nod off a couple of time ar pt the wheel   I have to pull over ten minute from my destination for a power nap to just get I there   I feel like crap and think my end be due   however y doc agree straight away to give I back my stresam and venlafaxine okay so I be back to   pill a day rather than   but I be happy again   I guess each drug work differently for each person
great question with today social lifestyle it be not unusual to have a drink or two with dinner or catch up with friend I have be on prozac for   year and enjoy different wine especially with meal drink every night be not advise as I find even one wine with dinner would make I feel drunk then the next day I would feel irritated and depress my doctor know I like a drink every now and then and say its fine in moderation so possibly special occasion or once a week   or   drink this medication be there to do a job that your body can not do on its own so if you drink constantly your reverse its benefit then its really not go to work for you if you enjoy a social drink I would advise to continue that but drink everyday be ceainly not go to help you with the treatment of whatever reason that yoy be on prozac
I take the exact same mg and the first time I drink with it it definitely cause I to have a panic attack drinking while take fluoxetine can cause your nervous system to intensify I still drink once every other weekend but I only have a drink or two and it basically feels double I get tipsy a lot fast since I take this medicine I have definitely cut back on my alcohol intake
be you use for bipolar   or anxiety    I give up drinking and it be be the good choice I stop have any day after blue
I would not risk it some antidepressant magnify the effect of alcohol so even one drink can feel like a lot more
when I be on it   I would drink cautiously if I be out to dinner the big caution I get be about drink and take xanax for my panic attack it be not recommend to drink while on ssris but you should be ask your pharmacist or your primary care if you be worried about side effect
I have drink on paxil and celexa do ok with a couple beer more than that or liquor give I anxiety
I do not risk any bad effect by be sober
alcohol bring on major anxiety for I too
my next day after drink tend to be my bad my anxiety be so high
all I can imagine   maini would put I over the edge I use to drink heavily until diagnose bipolar I use drink to try to sleep when I staed med I stop because my med help I sleep I try drink on the th   I would rather not feel horrible so thankful not dependant on it anymore
go to a psychologist and talk about it you probably do you would know I be diagnose   year ago and everybody have to walk a different path but I would avoid the antidepressant they be not effective in treat ptsd and that be all they get avoid any anti anxiety drug they be all highly addictive and stop work after awhile research cannabis it help with concentration and lose interest some strain can exacerbate symptom so do not rely on past experience and do not go out and get a joint from a friend that be what I have learn in those   year try to save you some pain talk to a psychologist and use their technique help and that be it find one that be not an idiot be another storylol
I write a letter to myself a while ago that anytime that I do not feel good I read it in the letter it state the good thing about myself and give I some inspiration I pull out that letter when I be feel down when I be feel angry when I be feel anxious try write yourself a letter it really help I oh when you be do with the letter put it back so that you can read it again next time

be honest with he he can be a big help once he know the problem believe I he have already notice your swing and anxiety he need to understand why   also hug and kiss be a fantastic medicine for you when he understand this come from my doc decade ago god help tremendously also
I would say be honest with your boyfriend explain that you be uncomfoable with the diagnosis and that be why you have not tell he I have similar difficulty with a female in the early year of my diagnosis she eventually find out from someone else and end the realationship because I have not be honest if he love you he will stay around half the battle with a mental health diagnosis be accept there be a diagnosis I know how difficult that can be however it can be a huge relief and you will feel much well just by accept that there be no shame that there be something wrong and you be not the only one as other have and do suffer the same and similar I have schizo affective disorder I hope all go well for you
never be scared to tell they I tell my boyfriend before we even staed date that I have severe anxiety disorder and depression
why in the world would you keep that from he this long he will probably be relieve know you have a reason for your action imagine what he think now it might help you to have someone that can help you realize when you be cycle my husband be a huge help let my doctor know when I be struggle most of the time we do not realize or remember how bad we have get time to put on your big girl pantie and tell he also get a new doctor there be no such thing as borderline bipolar kind of like be borderline pregnant
hunny you have to just do it he be either go to take it well or he be not you eat who you be and you should not be ashamed of that I have bpd anxiety panic attack and mood swing its life just be honest
you should not have to keep such a secret if your bf truly love you he will stand by you know matter what although it may take some time to get through and he may also be upset for not share your mental health issue with he soon you just need to rip that bandaid off my paner and I be high school sweethea he suffer from depression and have anger issue because of it and I suffer from depression and anxiety we can never seem to help ourselves in our time of need but we always stand by each other in those time of need moral of my story tell your paner if he love you he will stick by you my paner and I suffer from mental health long before we meet and now we conquer it together
mine know all about my bipolar should never feel ashamed of who you arebe honest with yourself so you can then be honest to your paner   I be sure he will understand
just be honest with he lovely   explain why you have be so worried about tell he before good luck be brave and go for it xx
I have a date last friday and tell the guy I be bipolar and depression I know I would have anxiety and be sweat and embarrassed but he tell he have a sex addiction and he be a councillor and think I be in good handsbut the sexual advance be awful and do not know how to react very uncomfoable and he tell I might have a hea attacki be so upset so say goodbye but do not feel good about myself at allso say all thatit make no difference so confusing and I have not be sleep for weeksthe next day I could not get out of bed and be cry all dayhe rang I and I could not talk to he be this normal to feel like thisso confusing and I wonder what I could have do differently
first of all I would be see a new doctor there be no such thing as borderline bipolar as a diagnosis you either have bipolar   or   or you have borderline personality disorder   second please be honest with your boyfriend if you have be with he for   year you should not be keep that from he although I be sure he have be through your high and low and might have an idea   be prepare though for he to possibly be upset that you have not be upfront with he
just be honest my husband have bipolar   paranoid schizophrenia as well as adhd I also suffer from severe anxiety we have always be   honest and upfront its a big key to build a solid foundation in a relationship if they truly love you they will be   suppoive
I be manic depressive and have anxiety there be day where I be petrify to leave the house because I just do not want to have to talk too or deal with peoplei tell my boyfriend now my husband   when we staed date if they care about you it will not matter just be you if there not ok with it then there no wohy of you
be honest if he truly love you   and you truly love he do it you have to I have see my girlfriend anxiety at a pretty bad state and I stay because I love she but she tell I early on
I be sorry hun you may not want to hear this but I be not sure you truly love he or your do not think he truly love you maybe both if its be this long and you have not   talk about it I have bipolar depression anxiety social anxiety abandonment issue and a truck load of physicalhealth problem so I kno those conversation do not come easy but they usually always in my case come in the begining of a relationship and I kno I want and need my bf of over yrs to be there for I when I be have an issue he be my rock like I say hun this all may be hard to hear and def not what you want to hear but I tell it like I see it and if at the   yr mark you still have not open up about whoyou really be be this really an honest good and real relationship good of luck   sweetie
tell he it be something he need to know if he do not already but it be an awesome feeling when ya get somebody to help you through your meltdown provide they can handle your mood swing but after   year I be sure he have some idea I tell my current paner before we actually get together after come out of a bad relationship with a guy who make I feel soo guilty for my thought n cut n meltdown
I be terrify of tell my boyfriend but I do and expect the bad however he laugh and say well I have already guess with the way your mood be so I have not do a very good job of hide it after all needless to say he now read up on how to cope with a bi polar girlfriend and he loves tell I new thing he learn from the reading up on it just tell he I be sure your anxiety will decrease substantially as well once your open and honest I know mine do x
woaw I could have never keep that hell I warn my husband   in pa so he know exactly what he be get himself into lol but yes after two year he be obviously see it all anyway just tell he at this point   the hard pa might be that he could be upset you do not tell he early   
after two year I be ceain he have go through your mood swing and anxiety with you he may already know and respectfully do not bring it up   communication honesty and trust be the key to build and maintain such a relationship
you should be honest love keep secret only cause you   stress and if they truly love you they will stay with you x
I highly suggest come clean about it since you have keep it a secret for so long just calmly bring it up and tell he that you be very sorry and be scared to tell himif he truly love youhe will talk it out with you
I have all but a few of these   people really do not understand our struggle be much more than just mood swing
photographic memory be completely go I have never feel so dumb in my life I also have many of those physical ailment more med on top of bipolar med currently add high blood pressure to the list more doctor more med
no doubt she probably the same
visteral   be a wonderful drugit help with my anxiety and with my sleeping
I have info on natural healing both spiritualy and holistic to reverse the symptom and ilness itself and get you off medication and live a happy and successful life   ptsd bipolar anxiety depression and all other disease
vistaril be a joke it be just glorify benadryl I try it and it do absolutely nothing for my depression or anxiety
I take vistaril for my anxiety it work good for I plus I have my depression medicine too
not a dr but vistoril be not as strong or long act in my opinion maybe an ssri would be well klonopin and vistoril do not treat depression and ssris like zoloft prozac lexapro and more work very well w anxiety and depression
everyone be different hey each be own if they prefer med r not I personally prefer marijuana it work for I in bipolar the one be min I be happy then   next up be sad   anxiaty for month r   sometimes then out of nowere il get up in the morning happy as kan be mind race like mtf want to do sooo nanny thing kuzz I do it go out my house for do month then that be when anxiety kick in kuzz in try to do n go everywere at one plusse they also diagnose with   different personally mood swing something like thatat time I can even deal with my own self I never know how il be when I wake up in the morningsa long as I have my weed I be good but I do not get to have it all the time do not always have the   for it I just refuse to take medication I have have very very bad experience with med
vistaril do not help I just give I shake fit
vistaril be antihistamine and nonhabitforme so to I it be woh a try in the past it help some of my anxiety but currently I be on gabapentin which be do a well job for I but that be a daily medication
I be on it as need only mgs it seem to help on day when I feel really anxious I can take it up to   time a day and if one mg do not work I can take another add up to mg and it seem to do the trick
vistaril work for I as an occasional as need anxiety medication
medication be likely go to be necessary it be ok come to term with that you will probably feel so much well and manage your illness will be far less stressful
I only use vistaril at night to help I sleep if I be restless knock I out literally within minute no way I can take it during the day for that reason
I have suffer from depression since I be   and recently the last couple of year I be have a lot of anxiety but I have never be put on med for either I have just learn to deal with it I guess and have learn how to pull my self out of it   now I be   this year and I think I may need some help as my mood swing be get to much I stress way to much or I feel down   do I have to go thru   different med to find the one for I or be they gunna make I bad be what be always turn I off
vistaril work enough to where I could work myself the rest of the way out of my panic attack
my daughter   take vistiril when she be have an anxiety attack   it calm she down but make she extremely sleepy
that make my anxiety sky rocket
vistaril be my go to for anxiety the klonopin be also in my blood
in my personal opinion if your anxiety be mild enough that take a benadryl would calm you down then it be perfect for you
I be go to get some sensitive plant seed and sta grow themwhen I use the leaflet in my tea and water I drink throughout the daymy ex tell I he see a huge difference in meiam go to do this ao I can get off medication cos it be soooooo not work for I eithersensitive plant be also know as tickle I plant or shy plant or sensitive weedwhit man have classifie it as a noxious weed but as we know most weed have medicinal propeie
I take it and it do not work at all they take my kolonopen and replace it with vistaril I be in hospital last week with major panic anxiety aytack
vistaril be a joke it do nothing for anxiety it be an allergy me
work great for mine but everyone be different and yes it be an antihistamine but antihistamine treat more than just allergy they also help with nausea insomnia and anxiety as well I like that I do not have to take it if I be have a good day and I also like that if I sta feel anxious I can take it and it work fairly quickly my anxiety be pretty well control without med most of the time but this med save I when it get bad
unfounately for I nothing work for my super anxiety as I call it I be prescribe valium mg   time daily and seroquel at least at night and when need during the day no driving during the day though when on seroquel after year of try this work for I
when it come down to it no one like medication I have decide to go off antidepressant and have reduce my dose by half in the last couple of month goal be not to be on they at all too many side effect include loss of libido and osteoporosis I know that antidepressant be a quick fix but after cry for a week and feel a sense of helplessness I get my sorry arse into gear and staed exercise and note an improvement immediately follow my first session I be look forward to get off the antidepressant for good I have bipolar and I would rather be blue than take too many medicine as well as not have to pay for another script as my shrink have tell I if you remove the stressor from your life that be cause your anxiety and depression consider not add they to your regime less med the well I believe I also do mental health nursing and have come to realise that the cocktail of medicine that people be on be nothing less than outrageous and these people be not feel well at all exercise force yourself its woh it and I be sure you will agree that it lift your mood even after one session good luck
visteril be actually an allergy   medication they also use for sleep and anxiety I have constant difficult anxiety and visteril do absolutely nothing for I I know med work different with each person this be just my experience the only thing that have work for I be a combination of a mood stabilizer anti depressant and dissolable klonipin I love the dissolable klonipin when I be stae to have an anxiety attack or my anxiety be just high in general I dissolve one of my klonipin in my mouth and it work almost instantly regular pill form do not work for I at all it just take too long and do not work the same good luck
I do not have severe depression or anxiety but be be treat for it I be on celexa and take xanax for night I can not sleep I recently have to change doctor and they try to switch I to vistaril for the sleep issue but I have to go back because it make I a zombie the next day
yep that sound like I   I stae abuse xanax so no benzodiazepine for I I take prozac and wellbutrin for depression tegretol for mood stabilizer and buspar for anxiety   if I can not sleep I take amytripolene sp
everybodys different in what medication work for they especially psychiatric medication I have to go through several before I finally find the right mixture pristiq lexapro klonipin and trileptal klonipin be the least impoant on the list because really it only help during the time my anxiety sta get out of control like before I go to work   I find klonipin work like a bandaid that easily come off because the effect be temporary have an antidepressant or mood stabilizer really help prevent the anxiety from come back as often and not be so horrible I hate medication too but I find out that they definitely help I function much easy and keep a job n such   but again everyone be different I hope you find some peace victoryhand
you be absolutely welcome I just stae a new great job myself and I be terrify the first couple of week lol I be still terrified everyday I go plus I be about to go back to school again for the fall semester which add to the stress but my medication help get I through   I hope you find the right medicine for you I know just do that be such a stressful and tiring process one of the medicine I take on my journey to find the right one make I produce breast milk and I be   at the time   but remember you be resilient I do not know who you be but I can already say you be strong because you fight the monster too along with try to live your life you will make it through to the other sidestronger   
seriously correct ty so much I be about to sta a new job a great job and I be terrify   I just want something to work then I read the could be side affect and I do not take it   
make I have the shake like they say it be a beefed up benadryl   make I wired and tired
klonopin can create anxiety as it wear off I would be more concerned about the klonopin than the new drug
I take it for my panic disorder along with prozac I take it at night since it be basically a strong benadryl it help I make sure you adjust the dosage to what work for you because if you do not sleep it off it will make you groggy
ugh see I try celexa for   month   then after a month once it kick in good it make I extremely unhealthy depressed like horrible but the month be great I finally stop take it when I realize why but I be super happy you all find something that help it be so hard   
celexa work well for both my daughter depression and mood disorder do not help I at all buspar seem to be help I only have be diagnose with anxiety though
celixia never work for I its one of the first med they put I on but I have severe panic attack doc call it high function axiety along with bipolar and complex ptsd with ocd and insomnia
I take it back when my anxiety be way bad it help but make I really sleepy
if you want to conquer the anxiety of life live in the moment live in the breath
I will admit though that breathing exercise do help when I be have an anxiety attack in jail and of course they do not care so I do not get any treatment I have no other way of get any relief
if I live in the moment my anxiety would be bad but thank for the unhelpful and insensitive advice
I have try breathe exercise yogamy anxiety and depression only get bad day to day
vistiril be basically an antihistamine that work on anxiety it be an amped benedryl it work when I take it until I build a tolerance
my anxiety would make I cry for no reason at all even if I have a reason it make it bad and uncontollable and I would end up in a major panick attack might not be on the right med or need an additional med to what you be already take have to increase my prozac to   mg and ativan mg   tab as need
I can relate my coworker have to pick up my work as I sit in the fitting room I work retail and cry I be demote and eventually firedi have not have a   job since because I panic to quick I be sorry I can not offer and help but you be not alone
this be your body natural response to be under stress and its not a bad thing at all you may find it an annoyance   yes but there be nothing wrong at all in fact you can learn to use this to your benefit   do not throw pill or label at it embrace it   animal like ourselves have flood of brain chemical to help with our flight or fight mechanism study it more and learn way to control it or munipulate it
I have this problem as well I be also bipolar too but it sound like you be stae to get panic attack which be often do by cry I would seek out a dr for anxiety med to help control the anxiety you have cry be normal most woman do it when they get stress out but if the crying get bad either go with medication or a counselor it will help stop the crying
someone once tell I that anxiety be energy trap in you you have to find your healthy release s hope this help
I have always struggle with this problem I have be accuse of wear my hea on my sleeve or be too emotional   or take thing to personal I have even lose job over it no one understand what it be like to have all these thing roll around in your head that you can not control bipolar   anxiety bpd ptsd it may not be the good solution but what I always do be I would pinch my leg or back until I could get to somewhere private and then I would cry by my self just enough to deal til I could get through the day and then cry all the way home
dang   anxiety panic   can you go to the bathroom and sit quiet and focus on you breathe   just calm dowm
I can definitely relate I cry not because sadupset but when I be so frustrated then I get angry because I be cry I have learn at work where it can get bitchy to walk away otherwise I go off big time and become very nasty some do not like I walk away but it be a strategy I use
cry be our bodys way to release stress so cry if you need to do not get angry when you do that cry be just like poope do you get angry if you poop no right because your body need it just think of it that way and if you be uncomfoable do it in front of other people do it at night in your room or cr before you get overwhelmed by your emotion or just have a routine of do it every night just like an exercise
yes it help but can medication help a bit    and witch one for stress
this be a problem that I have as well   I be bi polar but the med do not seem to help this I think because it be stress relatedi have have boss who question my maturity because of it deep breath do not work for I seperation do but sometimes this be not possible I be sorry if this be not helping   just know that someone else can totally relate
I wish I have advice I have just be diagnose bp and have the same thing happen my last boss would make I feel so bad about myself I end up quit before I have a new job line up and life have be hell same experience though I would get work up and get emotional mostly cry and he would judge I and make I feel less than a person and incompetent like I could not do my job I hate work every day and now I be not sure if it be my med not work or if I be just so over stressed make   of my previous wage and be unceain daily of how I be eatingpaye bill put gas in my car to get to work that I end up cry at work every day still luckily not in front of a boss or customer I can not take it much more hang in there hopefully someone can give we something helpful   
I have ptsd and I find if I get stress my emotion get out of control and my pain level increase dramatically I be take med to help stabilize the dramatic mood swing but also try to find other way to release the stress as well deep breathing with my eye closed walk away from the stress even if it be for a few minute have someone you can vent to etc especially at work really help
bipolardepressionanxiety open page   please stop post such small image   they show up really blurry and we can not read what they say
sometimes they do this   upsetting
I have suffer for many year and now I suffer deep depression I use to go to bed late and get up late change my med and now get up early my yr old son be depress he use to have a go at I for stay in bed till late and now he be do it when I try to get he out and talk to he about his life he throw my depression back in my face he will not seek help and hate that I take med last time I change to these med I do really well but have panic attack a few night run so go back to my old one this time they be not help I know it be because of my son feel useless because I can not help he   
everyone on here be give you excellent advice never go off any med cold turkey I go through hell and back with a horrible psychiatrist who set I back by many year my first suicide attempt my second attempt and now med change my current doc be wonderful she agree to ween I off effexor and she be do it in a way   that it will be month before I be fully off of it so far I can deal with it because I know it be go to be there   please be careful
the withdrawal be horrible and you should never have be in that tip begin with honestly talk to another doctor for advice about go off of it
every cell and every organ of your body depend on serotonin   your body supply will have to regulate and you can not expect this to happen overnight   how long have you be on paxil   I think the very good advice be to work with your physician to taper it down very gradually   make sure you be hydrate really well and eat a good diet   some of the symptom can be very difficult to cope with   when I go off it abruptly it sound like a freight train or a car go by every time I turn my head   evidently very tiny structure in your brain have to equalize and it take time   look up site that advise about taper off medication because those be write realistically by people who know what it be really like   there be pharmacist who can compound the paxil to a gradually low and low dose   it can take month   I recently go down on my dose of effexor and depakote   I would say to be really good about stress during this time   prepare yourself for rough relationship really welllike see an x   there be long term impact from these medication that medical science be find out   a pill enter our entire body   we want to be as cognizant of the side effect as possible   prescriber will not ask you if you have they   they will not even usually do the right test   the physician and the psychiatrist draw a line in concrete concern what be each of their job   weaning take time so there be not a rapid return of depression and anxiety and you do not get the withdrawal symptom
brooke l morgan my advice would be to keep a daily journal of mood sleep irritability   and anxiety symptom
electroshock sensation run down their arm that be nervous system and not something to mess around with even if they be wean this be not something to take lightly but I have never hear of anyone have withdrawal this severe when wean it have nothing to do with pain tolerance at all
have a girlfriend with bipolar I see how people act and treat she if you do not know or understand bipolar or any other mental health issue they either do not want to know or take advantage of your good nature this hus I because people will never know the struggle and pain my girlfriend go through she be the most wonderful amazing woman I have ever meet and would not change anything ever people be uneducated and need to stop watch tv programme and think every one with mental health issue be the same

in my opinion after all the hype surround this movie as the scary movie ever the blair witch project be a truck load of shit
of course it be script it be a work of fiction the way it be shoot be original at that time and see in the theater be a great experience because it ampe up the tension as it go along and you could really feel what the character be feel the actor be give a basic script drop off in a forest and leave to improvise a lot and capture their real reaction because they do not really know what to expect and I think that really help the overall feel of the movie I know some people do not care for it but I just love it smilingface
I remember when it come out and people be actually scared I know from the first viewing that it be fake and scripted   still bug I
the ring it be not even scary and it be predictable
absolute fear suck I be mad

I be sorry you be in this it be not a relationshipit be an unhealthy toxic co dependency leave walk away no excuse if he be a narcissist he will do all he can to manipulate you to stay this cd be the turning point in your life when you learn to become your own good friend   put yourself first it be ok to have your fear but do not let they dictate your action and keep you in it may you have miraculous solution and the suppo you need
you need to leave the abusive relationship as you can not work on your own need I put up with it for   year and raise   child l also have bipolar but be not diagnosis I until l be   please do not make your life so much hard than it need be there be a lot of help and good medication out there to help you I be here if you need to talk anytime good luck and do not be afraid as you deserve a good life xxx
be you able to search for another job so that you can leave the relationship and if you need someone to talk to you can message I or add I as a friend I have depression and anxiety myself so I understand
the truth I be about to share with you could hu your feeling just a head   up but the truth hus come from someone who just call off my engagement and   year long relationship that type of shit do not change if he cheat on you and seem like he do not care about put in the effo to understand the struggle you have with your mental health then he do not care I be brutal with the truth and if you have to question whether they care that mean they do not because if a man love you you know he love you without a shadow of a doubt man be usually an eye on the prize type so if he do not care you will know it by how he make you feel I be sorry you be go through this
also your man be suppose to be your protector he be suppose to keep you safe from harm not put you in harm way by physically abuse you you do not hit the woman that you love that be not love my dear do not let he ruin your outlook on love and relationship because that be no measure or example of love or of what a man be keep your head up and even though you do not know I I be here if you need to vent to someone I have find that sometimes vent to somebody you do not even know be really stress relieve
I be in that situation before and it take I over a year to get out of it it be tricky because we also work in the same place until he force I to quit I constantly be worried he be cheat because he have in the past and thing get really bad in the end I eventually just leave he in the middle of the night the first few week be really hard but after that thing do get some well you can do this if you need someone to talkvent to I be here lose and forget
my advice get out of the relationship as soon as possible get friendsrelativespolice involve in order to remove your thing without feel threatened
I hve ptsd severe depression n n high function anxiety along with a few mre my hubby do not talk much about my illness but he do suppo I any way he can sound like you need a fresh sta new job take some time to discover urself if he s abusive n down right that bad yes leave he you could n need so much well hang in there   life be possible even for we with mental illness jst take a lil patience n understanding from people we love but please get urself away from that kind of abuse it will only make you be symptom bad till you can not handle it anymre
I know this be go to be hard but you need to leave he be abusive he do not need to be physical to abuse you he be control you mentally by not allow you to work   through your problem and make then seem like a burden which they be not   please for your safety get out of that relationship then you can work on get your mental under control I be almost the exact same boati could only like read half cuhz my ptsd from my ex and he like to sleep deprive I to the point I would hu myself to try and get some sleep and then he would accuse I of do it for attention but as soon as I leave he alot if my problem cease greatly at least to the point be I know if get help I would be able to get well   and I do and it be be almost   year since I get away and I be do so much well two year from now I would love to hear about your progress   but my fear be if you continue this path with that man in two year I may be read your obituary
get out while you can next time you be alone pack all of you be stuff and run this person will only get bad he be play on you be anxiety and think ull never leave a year ago I get out of a relationship just like that one and I be so much well off
please leave make a list of what you need to do and follow it one step at a time toxic people around you need to be go from your life without guilt and then eventually you sta to feel well and positive people will find you so you can sta take care of you you be impoant and it be hard for   you to move on but it will be awesome to have breathing room you have to take care of yourself
please leave what seem impoant to you now be nowhere near as impoant as your life he will never understand your ptsd anxiety or depression he will be violent again and it will get bad he will use your issue against you he will blame his behavior on your symptom he will make you feel like you be nothing please do not let he have that power over you I have lose   home   tooth suffer broken bone and bruise be choke nearly lose my life be abandonde neglect and use in all that pain and confusion you be feel right now dig deep and find enough love for yourself to save yourself I have be homeless for over a year it suck to no end but I be still alive and move forward have I stay I be confident I would not be here right now hope with all my hea you leave before force to endure what I have already survive I do not know your man at all I recognize every detail you give as I have already live it free yourself you will be so glad you do
look for another job in a way that will not let he find out that where there be no conflict once you get one get out of there be in a toxic relationship or with someone that cheat or be abusive can give you ptsd itself I have be cheat on and I understand the anxiety aspect of that it take over your every thought I be so sorry you have to go through this I be just get out of a toxic relationship and leave be one of the hard thing I have ever do

try speak to somebody as well then during it a friend or somebody you live with distract yourself might work or go to your doctor as they should be able to get you in contact with a physiatrist to help you get over the fear   be it something you have have since a child or be it from a trauma like mine

I lose my mum from suicide in march   it be the hard thing ever to deal with   I be still and will be struggle for such a long time   I miss she and wish I could have tell she how much she mean to be before she take her own life my hea break over and over
I do understand my flatmate be murder by her ex   year ago I blame myself for not be able to save she I promise she that everything would be ok   but we be still alive   and they would not want we to suffer or feel guilty   but yes its over well send love and hug   I wish I could take your pain away   but if you need a friend I be here
you be not responsible for someone else action however guilty you may feel please seek professional suppo if you have not already for your loss you can not get through all the emotion on your own the question will always be there it do not get easy you just slowly learn to keep go
suicide be not selfish   it be a last desperate act by a human who be suffer so much agony they think that die be the good solution   why do we as society try to put blame on or label something like this instead of ask how or why they end up think that way   selfish be ignore someone who be suffer that much selfish be label they as crazy or selfish or need to just get over it selfish be push aside question that need to be ask for the quick and easy answer of they where just selfish and think only of themselves   do not blame yourself for someone else decision to end their life do not blame they for make that decision either what be the point will assign blame bring they back will be able to label it really make thing well no it will not   in fact it will probably only serve to make you feel bad   mental anguish be an epidemic that be spread at alarming rate   and we still refuse to ask the right question we still just want something or someone to blame   be not that selfish
I carry the weight for   of my friend the first one talk to I that night and be explain some of the problem go on in his family   and be say his sister want to commit suicide he go home after take I home and hang himself I feel like I could of do more know he be feel that way I would of never leave he my second friend have some issue   he call I the day before and ask I if I could give he a reason to live and we be enteaine the idea of a relationship but he be hang up on some one else and could not move on he want I to want he and I push he away and he kill hisself   I be drown in the guilt I do not know how to stop blame myself
my dad end his life yr ago up until about yrs ago I blame myself it be shameful then so do not talk about it have to tell people that he just die my depression staed then finally get help for myself and the psychologist tell I that it be not my fault and then my mum tell I that my dad have mental issue I sometimes still feel guilt but that be because I suffer deep depression I wonder if I could have stop he by tell he that I love he in the end it be their decision and you just have to accept that they have a problem that they could not overcome   
perhaps never which be one of the reason I refuse to do itafraid of the legacy

I have the same problem only I hate family gathering I always feel they be watch I to see if I say the wrong thing if I do not say anything they wonder if I be mad or sick I have a lot physically wrong with I then you add bi polar I also have chronic depression and anxiety I worry about everything I work myself up over thing that turn out okay I constantly be consume by death planning in my head my funeral and everything I guess I be want to make sure they get it right I do not want to die I would not take my life for my religious conviction I just think about it maybe because of my health thing I love to do I can not I still can read and use my computer for two hour circulation in my leg I be   and have be sideline since I be another thing be all I do be talk to my sister about what doctor I go to and what they find they do not want to think of those thing they do not want to loose I god bless you dear one day at a time and no matter what you be wonderful
I be not sure it work in the uk but I use cbd oil for anxiety it have ton of heath benefit include anti anxiety but be also use commonly for child with epilepsy and other illness it be extract from cannabis but there be no thc content so no head high or anything
I take ativan for my anxiety and it help I to sleep and stay asleep
I have the same issue not want to shower and my house be a mess I want to shower and clean but I just can not today I sleep most of the afternoon like I have for the last few day I also have a   yr son I be try to explain to my bf about my illness bipolar stage   ocd panic attack anxiety attack possible ptsd and he be like I do not care I do not have to deal with it
I understand your frustration while my circumstance be different in many way I be similar I can leave my house but I also want desperately to be a functional member of society I want to work so badly unfounately it can take time medication also be not a quick fix I have bipolar   and ptsd my depression be very severe but it can and will get well you just need to be patient if you have be on this med a while it might be woh try something else it could also be an idea to ask your psychiatrist for a second opinion keep fight I assure you it will get well hug
I have be on the same med for   yrs so I tell the dr my anxiety be get bad I have so many med allergy or bad reaction I get scared to try other med but I go through about   month a try different med end up in these class bc nothing would work or I be allergic I have be put back on the original med of zoloft with with   sequel the sequel have help the panic but the depression be off the chain the dr say my fightflight switch have be turn on and my brain do not let it turn off my house here have so much mold grow and my husband will not fix it so I feel I be not keep my young daughter safe and I need to get out of this house which mean I feel this huge pressure to work and then I get my mind all work up into a really bad state
it be not bullshit you can not make comment like that unless you have be in the situation which I personally have it do not say everyone with a mental illness have addiction it be say they be at a much high risk of addiction also addiction can be other thing than substance abuse gambling addiction and food addiction be just some other example
never touch or try alcohol   no drug and no cigarette so it be a choice to pick they up and sta but yes I can turn into a disease but just because I deal with anxiety and stuff I still deal with it without those thing
just write about this this do not mean all people struggle with mental illness have addiction issue the point to take from this be people who have substance addiction be usually struggle from their own mental illness most people addict to substance be struggle with their own emotional battle and they should not be stigmatise for it
I can see where this be come from I be diagnose with bipolar nearly   year ago after attempt suicide my mechanism to cope have always be food hence the size I be I find it very very hard to not eat junk food to some people that may be confuse even though I have attempt to loose weight every single minute of my life I be think about junk food so totally agree when it say it come hand in hand with addiction
this mentality be why I be not prescribe helpful med for anxiety
relationship be hard with my first marriage I have be emotionally abuse I think I would die too but I push past that and now I be remarried and happy have suicidal thought be normal I have have depression anxiety bipolar you name it I have it however each day I wake up it be another day I have fight my demon you need to find what be good for you do not be ashamed of get help life be hard deal with mental illness and a lot of people can not figure out how to overcome it just remember even though you suffer everyday you be fight a battle that can be win it do not define who you be with what you have life have a funny way of of show that there be hope out there you just have to see it good luck I honor you for go for your dream in the air force just remember even though you suffer everyday you will survive it be not your time yet
you need to see another psychiatrist get help fast I also consult with the mental health in my job   useless I feel even more angry and helpless work relate mental health be prejudiced and do not have your good interest take leave and get some rest avoid negative people and people who have no understanding or interest I live in south africa and be founate to have a wonderful psychiatrist   and to finally find the right combination of medication to work for I I be a nurse I will pray for you
year ago I be where you be feel same feeling I could not even get out of bed my mom have home care and her nurse be like family they give I hour to make the decision to commit my self or they be go to do it for I I spend day in the psych unit and I staed at the beginning of what I think be wrong and I be show what be really wrong please do not give up some how you be not find the right persondr whomever it take I year and I be learn how to live with I again one day at a time I have manic depressive and bipolar with social anxiety disorder depression and bipolar be seperate thing that need to be treat differently not all jumble together you be not alone
I be diagnose bipolar one   year ago after have a psychotic episode out of the blue I always have depressionanxiety and have many label now I have be on mg of lithium for   year and after so many med I be on   lamotragine   quitiapine mg diazepam and a sleeping tablet I be no long allow to take anti depressant as it only take   year to find out they make I high lead to   hospital stay now I stay out of hospital but be very low and feel I be not on the right med but scare to change as I have put on too much weight already now I know it be sweet etc do not help but I be never as heavy than when I be put on med every night I feel I be take poison and right now I have lot of stress and feel like cry a lot go to see gp soon to talk about my mental health I be not ashamed to admit to bipolar etc but the term mental freak I out I be convinced I will never recover from this awful illness xx
I go through the same thing I be devastate because in my head no offense to anyone on this page or anywhere mean it mean it be bad than previously think and I have find such comfo in be able to justify it as only type   however when I be on a medication regime as well as therapy regime that work for I along with healthy eating and exercise as much as I can because I have cerebral palsy it be easy to navigate let we say not always deal with but navigate I have no doubt you will be able to as well with the right tool ask for help take care of yourself the good you can and be honest with doctor that last one use to be hard for I because I be so scared of my symptom much luck to you redhea
if you need medication to help you feel well there be no shame to that in fact do it really matter which diagnosis you have by that I mean it be so impoant for we to know what be go on and why but then we come up with a game plan when my biological mother be alive there be not as much advancement as there be now in mental illness in define it and in treat it you be not alone I know how difficult that can be and how lonely we can feel I do know that once I staed to understand what be happen to I and why it help because I now know it be not a failing of mine it be my brain there be no shame in that can the medication help if so it seem like it may be woh a shot I recommend write down a list of what your concern be talk it out with your psychiatrist take your time and go through all your fear and concern so that you can find a medication that may help then sta at a low dose and work your way up listen there be so many people who share your diagnosis mental illness be no different from any other illness in the sense that it be an illness if you can treat it please do so in the good way for you I be sorry you be go through this and I wish you the good please remember that you be not alone

no you need a psychiatrist and I highly doubt you have bipolar if your mood change several time in one day it be borderline personality disorder if they take a week or two to change between extreme high and extreme low it be bipolar but how you explain it it be most ceainly not bipolar which med do not fix borderline personality disorder

there be lot of thing that you can control in your life to help you not get that speed up high   like get the same amount of sleep every night   like not drink too much coffee   sometimes one cup be too much and have a list of thing to do to slow yourself down   if I sense myself stae to mouth off I go in my room and I get more rest   stop the acceleration   I pray   but everyone be different and antidepressant because mood swing into mania if we be prone to it   I be begin to think that there be a lot of people who might be well off not on long term antidepressant like they get leave on thembecause of all the side effect   take another medication that have more serious side effect to cover the first medication side effect be not real sma   I be sixty two and now find out I have damage to my liver and kidney   I also take naproxen and lot of tylenol the past eighteen year   I do not realize the cost   also there be weight gain and that be depressing which make a vicious cycle   take as little as you can of these med and do all you can to be healthy on a regular schedule not overwork and discipline yourself before you get stupid   I find out that when I be tired stressed overwork feeling alone and desperate in try to solve problem that be when I be in danger of do something stupid   live your life with care   spos and physical exercise that be safe and not excessive can really help   some people can take less medication because they exercise on a regular basis   some people get manic and abuse drug or alcohol because they like the feeling and want to stay feel on top of the world but do not be tempt   any overdoing it in any area be dangerous   be extremely cautious in relationship   especially get into they a good person be not in a rush to get into a relationship   if you be your normal self you will be careful and be safe   write out a plan for stay safe and balanced and not go off the deep end when you sta to get speed up   notice the first sign of getting speed up   for I it be not sleep   have a few people to confide in what be really go on   keep a diary   keep a mood cha   spending can be dangerous   careful in all the area that you might get carry away   in depression you might not be good enough to yourself or seek a pick I up of spirit that will not last   I read the bible and I pray   I like to read psalm in the bible   it be write in a different time   war time and by a king who have many enemy so there be reference to thatbut it be awesome in prayer and praise to god   depression and illness be our enemy   psalm help I trust in god and get my feeling out to god   then the gospel remind I of who jesus be and what he have do and will do for I if I have faith and ask   do not be alone and do not let pill be the only answer   some mood be normal   our enemy be the one that take control and be hard to get loose from   be wise and ask god for wisdom   proverb in the bible say that there be success in have many advisor   counselor help you check in with how you be do   if you do not like one get another one but give one a chance a few session at least   unless you can tell right away they be not for you
jennifer cut the reason I say that shit be cuz in tired of people shit I be tired of everything try hard and fall way below the di I be tire of try to better myself it only make thing bad so I be give up and just go where the shit train take my miserable ass
brandy rutherford I have the same problem with weed use to smoke to avoid the med make I sick to my stomach every time I still try every once in a while hope to go back to it I think I be alone I have never hear of any one else get sick from it
yes it do help in small amount though and only use when expirience high level of anxiety or depression it be not good to use it all the time because it will loose its effect after a while and actually do damage and can also create paranoia
ask about geodonit be somewhat new but help I a loti have be on almost all bipolar medsbut stay away from benzodiazepine for anxietyif you ever come off themit be horrible
benzo actually do not seem to help my anxiety much and I be put on a regular and increase dosage which I question but doctor insist it be fine give I memory loss and make learn impossible do not connect the dot until after semester end and it be too late I think I would have be alright have I only use it if I feel the point of no return for a panic attack come I will have to keep that geodon in mind if I need to readdress thing my current doctor only have I on adhd med now I know bipolar be not out of the question as well
geodon be horrid the withdrawal be bad ever experience than any other drug or benzoa well cause heavy weight gain
I would say there be no question you be on the bipolar spectrum I be bipolar I with mixed feature my episode be a lot more intense than yours at time but about the same a lot of the time adhd and anxiety disorder be also highly comorbid I would see a psychiatrist as suggest by miranda
I think you should not have to pick between they they be your parent that say if they push you to choose that can be hard I know I have to constantly remind myself my parent be human have fault make mistake I turn   tomorrow and I think teenyoung adult you see more of reality kind of like if you ever go to someone for homework help and one day after some year your question pass what they can help you with or you catch mistake that your parent be not the exact way you think as a kid create a lot of stress at that age alone my mental health stuff be diagnose in my s my parent have little experience in this dept and I have learn I can not force people to learn can not get they to try not to say or do thing that can lead I to get fairly sick I can learn way to adapt to the environment I be give so for that I honestly think a professional suppo system for you be first and foremost I kind of blow off impoance of psychotherapy biofeedback focus on the physiatrist and med not sma for my situation I have do the opposite off med think I could muscle through and I have spin my wheel go nowhere frustrate for a long time thinking since I try doctor or therapist a and b and it do not work so it must be I this be as good as it get do not bother look for option c same concept with med but I think if you seek out a mental health care professional that you can trust and that be listen to you they not only help you navigate other stuff but also help you in how to address the parent thing how to navigate through those who do have impact on your health but whose action you can not directly control I think that be huge but often overlook not only will you learn skill as tool for get through those issue but it will give you some solid ground to come back to and stand on through that therapistdoctor if you be see someone now be honest with yourself if you be not progress be it a simple fix on your end or do you just not click shuffle around happen all the time

and sometimes the crack show so every one can see the pain in my leg be so bad I fall an hit my head never have problem with it before the doctor say it be my anxiety play up and I be feel pain where there be none   
unimaginable and invisiblei do not know if this can be count as a mental illness or maybe the symptom of depression and anxiety that I have but I buy a new phone very expensive a   month woh of my salaryi love the cyan one I buy be it board and hard fry after   hour of use then I return an they tell I there be no cyan color on the market anymore you have to buy the black one all the excitement that I have for the cyan one when I be look at it and the faint happiness that it give I be now turn to anger hate and disgust and even a mental pain when I be look and hold the black one in my handi cry and cry when I have to use my phone it may seem ridiculous to everyone but the pain I feel be very real sadly and there be nothing I can do I want to accept and move on but this pain have already chain and nail I down to the ground really hardwhy it have to be this way I always have wonder
sometimes though it get overwhelming   this weekend the world fall through   work stress mostlyi would love to call in sick tomorrow and extend a four day weekend into five just to spare myself the agony of deal with the same issue I have be deal with for month   but I can not   I have to be the responsible one   no matter how much it be go to rip I apa to show up tomorrow
first I would look for suppo group in your area they be free and can be quite helpful always make sure you follow up with your doctor and let they know what be go on too there be also website and chatroom for people with mental illness where you can have a safe place to vent open up and seek suppo of other that actually can relate to your situation and struggle also it be helpful to have hobby to distract bad thought and try to do the thing you love as much as possible you can do it I wish you all the good

anxiety be a hell of a thing
my job be extremely physically strenuous people think as the day go on that I be just get tired I suppose I be lucky that that be a logical excuse but it be really because my anxiety escalate as the day go on only a couple people at work know about my battle with depression but only one who I really trust to tell know about the anxiety it really be painful to hide it
ian   you be so right it be painful to hide it I use to be a master at put on the happy face and hide my anxiety not so much anymorethis monster have a hold of I and it be truely scary give yourself credit that you can still hold a job a strenuous one as well I have to leave my job   year ago and have yet be able to return to work due to all this good wish to you and may peace shine down on you
only people who know I really well can see the little sign of my anxiety get the well of I my sister can hear the change in my voice my husband see how I stare at a wall when I be try to do something cuz I physically can not get my brain to focus on what I be do
so thing may have take an even bad turn I just have a mental break down just now and well let we just say it be not a pretty sight I may have scare my family a little all I can say be it be well need feeling that tiny bit well now but feeling do not change that easily
marcus I be very sorry you be deal with this right now actually I turn   today and the past few year have be really hard for I sound like you have be do a lot of wheel spin too frustrated tired discourage that this be it for your option and they be not work I can not say I know your experience but I be bet those component list be there at your doctor I would tell they straight up what you say regard the med to we that you be afraid to go back on that because it only make thing bad I applaud you for have the courage to speak to stranger on here and also make that dr appointment courage energy and rational thinking and you have all of those you have much to miss in this world stay around if you can I know it be hard to see past the hell you be go through I get it so in that case wait until tomorrow when you can see past it again whether tomorrow be   hour from now week month that tomorrow will come sometimes you can not force yourself to be optimistic but you can look forward to the day when you can if anything I would say try to wait that moment out I think you have the strength and will as you have be able to take some big step in talk to we and make that appointment there be those that struggle in take those step keep fighting do not hesitate to talk to we on here
fear have two meaning   you can live past   since you say you do not actually want to give up that mean there be fight in you your depression what it do it take your wing only forget you still have your claw        redhea fight man you be not weak you just forget how strong you be when life knock you down calmly get up smile and say you hit like a bitch I would be lie if I say I never feel suicidal I be diagnose with ptsd depressionchronic insomnia which would cause both visual and audible hallucination at   then   year ago diagnose with social anxiety and panic disorder the med I take for anxiety be lamotrigine actually fucking help I could not believe it and for depression and insomnia I take trazadone for I these help amazingly especially trazadone I be on the low dose and only need to take half at night to sleep and I have see much improvement with my depression but it be no cure so of course my episode sneak their way back in but I be so happy I at least feel well to where I do not feel like I be ache to die anymore because it be just so exhausting I hope this help a little and just know that I will be think of how you be do and I care I really do wish you the good take care

how can you even win with answer this question the people we leave behind be go to say we r selfish but we know we be not and have validate that in our own mind try to convince the people that be leave behind that in fact we be not be selfish be something they can not understand mental illness and the suffering that we go through be not any different than any other debilitate illness if we have come to peace with those term to end our suffering remember it be ours than that be by our choice   my child have watch a lifetime of a sick mother and a well mother and although if this be my choice to end my life yes they would be sad but would completely understand and not for a minute say that I be be selfish be raise with a mentally ill family member they have learn that ultimately this could happen I could also have a hea attack too would they be any less upset no
suicide be never ok it be unfounate that our mind get so desperate to relieve ourself from what ever it be where going throw that we be trick into think this be the answer   perhaps it be your answer but that do not make it ok there be nothing ok with a life be take even if it be your own your taking

unpopular opinion warn I firmly believe that there should be an option for human euthanasia in case where the person have be treat for a suitable length of time and analyse by different doctor and all other option have be exhaust if the person would still prefer death to the hell they suffer every day in their own mind I think that there should be a mandatory waiting period for they to change their mind or for family member to step up their game on offer actual help the family should be present to say final goodbye alleviate their guilt and also mean no family member will discover the body which be extremely traumatic before a painless euthanasia be perform have this option available may prevent botch suicide attempt which can actually lead to injury that ruin the person life even more
my perspective I abhor the fact that people still stay that suicide be selfish it be not it personally irritate I when people say think of how many people you will hu I think these be all comfoing cliche that people just use just to use it that be why get to know people be impoant   because the cliche I just mention I bet a few other feel this way those comfoe cliche   may only hu more for example those two phrase   hu bad and as a person struggle with suicide ideation right   now that those two phrase just make it bad   for I   because I be a ward of the state my parent give I up and I do not know the rest of my family I can not connect with peoplei just feel I be socially awkward or an introve so right now I feel really alonebut to be honestsucide be not right but what do you do when you have give life your all and you have try to remain positive with such a crappy hand that be deal especially since day   you be tell you be a mistake   can you say those comfoe cliche then    I have bpd depressionptsd and   anxietyi be not try to be a debbi downer kind of feel like I need some helpsome people have no idea   what be go through a person mind about suicide let we be mindful of that
I have to comment I be a suicide surviverwhen you have reach that deep dark place you do not think of your childreni have   they never even enter my mind I just have an overwhelming need for peace in my headyou do not think rationally otherwise the devastation you will leave behind will stop you do itno one want to diethey just want peace

the idea of suicide be selfish be a selfish notion in itself constantly hear or see people saywrite but what about the people you leave behind of which the person speakingwrite be usually one do not help anything people who commit suicide believe without a doubt that they be do the good thing for everyone they know it be not simply about their own pain or mental stateit be much deep and much more complex than that as someone who attempt suicide multiple time when I be young I can tell you with complete ceainty that when you make the decision to take your own life it be more about remove the burden of have to care for or deal with their issue
I have attempt suicide when I be young and I suffer from depression and anxiety to tell someone that be deal with those disease that suicide be a selfish act be wrong you can not make a person who be already feel an immense amount of guilt and anxiety about themselves feel even more guilt and stress by tell they to think about their friend and love one in those desperate moment of suicidal contemplation they probably feel incredibly alone and misunderstood make they feel bad do not help their brain do not work that way they may even think that by kill themselves they be do what be right for their friend and family they may think that suicide be actually a selfless act I be not say that suicide be the right way I be just say that if someone be contemplate it instead of put they down for it try and understand why they be feel that way try to encourage they to get help
wow so many amazing comment on here and great feedback   suicide will always bear a special place of empathy sympathy and compassion in my hea because I have be down that rabbit hole so to speak and have see the darkness   I fear that darkness will return in my life again someday and know that terrify I I can only hope that I have as good a suppo structure as I do now to get I through future episode of bipolar and depression   I do not think there be a straight answer for when suicide be ok or not ok because on the one hand if you say it be never ok be not you undermine the severity of the person situation maybe it be more humane to let a person go with dignity through assisted suicide I do not know there be no easy answer
I do not have an opinion about ok or not ok   I do have this thought be you ready to give up what you will be miss   be it so bad that nothing be woh live for because of what you have to live through    the pain the numbness the sadness selfdoubt and lack of motivation can be the most difficult thing in the world to deal with   I understand completely   I have be there   I have be there with the blade against my wrist   I think for a moment that nothing be leave that could balance this weight   I be wrong about that and realize it be what save I I want you to do something before you consider whether or not it be ok   I want you to find something   anything   it do not have to be any paicular thing   find that thing and really experience it   whatever it be   really take the time to live it   to get cliche a sunrise a hug a puppy be all good example   but it can be literally anything that you think of   live it and and repeat a few time with other thing   once you have do that think about whether or not you be ready to give it all up   everything   every experience   every potential joy no matter how fleeting   everyone   everywhere   be you ready to give it all up to quieten your brain remember that no person be ever so much of a burden that they need to take themselves out of the equation and that everything you experience be valid and vital to you   nothing about you be wohless because you be a mind and feeling and thought and idea and an identity that will never exist again and have never exist before   you be invaluable and of incalculable woh think about all of this before you decide anything please   you be precious and it would be a shame to lose you
never ok but I understand the motivation far too well we be overwhelmed by chronic pain that no one near understand mental health treatment have become inhumane
it be never ok to give up even though in that moment it can feel like you be do a favor for your love one and finally achieve some kind of peace   the reality of all of this be simple it be just life and we have to live it and this be what our life be sometimes a constant struggle to feel anything sometimes it be a constant struggle to not feel too much or think of get it scream or whatever be go on   there be someone that love you and depend on you whether it be your spouse child parent a friend or someone in this group that you have save more than once   give up be not an option
I can not believe for one second that anyone on a page about bipolar depression and anxiety would promote suicide for someone struggle with mental health issue   what the hell be wrong with some of you   I have die   time from sudden cardiac death twice in front of my wife and   time on the operating table   I have endure   major hea surgery in   year   I have severe depression anxiety panic attack agoraphobia and severe ptsd   some day the weight of the world keep I in bed all damn day   sometimes all damn week   but I forge on   I take my med   I go to weekly therapy session   I ride my motorcycle   I exercise when I can   I love my   kid and my   suppoive wife   I find goal and chase they down right now my masters degree   I force myself into situation I hate I have literally have the barrel of a loaded   gauge in my mouth with the finger on the trigger   it take all my strength to not do it   all my will power to realize all of the good thing I love in life   remember suicide be far reach   have I pull that trigger the consequence in the future for my own small child grand child etc could have be dire it be never an option   get help now
death be death whether the person die of a hea attack stroke or suicide it be still death just because a person want to end their pain we should react differently any time a love one pass away it be go to be difficult it be go to hu regardless most who mourn suicide struggle with their own guilt because they feel they could have help suicideassiste suicide be not black and white   and it be not selfish it be very calculated if you have never face death you would not know the pain
never   there be always hope as long as there be breathe   I have have suicidal thought   I know that this all be a spiritual battle and that god help we when we come to he in prayer   I have a slogan for those time when thing be at the bad   it go like this    thing will not always be this way   I have to tell you that we must fight a spiritual war to survive sometimes   we have to choose life   jesus have give I the hope to get through the tough time   I may fall apa for a while but I know that I have solid reason to go on living   do not ever ever allow yourself to dwell on the thought of give up   you have a choice to make in what you think about   billy graham say something that stick with I that apply   he say that just because a bird fly over your head do not mean that you have to let it build a nest in your hair   make sense to I   we can choose our thought   we can read   for I it mean meditation on the bibleon spiritual reality and promise from god himself and read how he have be faithful in the life of other   it give I strength   and hope   and speak of strength and hope we can pray for strength and hope and every other solid spiritual gift we need   we can pray for wisdom and guidance from god   the truth be we give up way too easily and let it become a habit   you have to fight for your mental health   to succeed mean that you fail and get up and fight for it again and again and again   each time you get up you gain strength and determination because you learn that you can take a rest but that you can and will get up strong   yes strong   strong from go through defeat yet not be defeat   you be still alive still try and lose even the faint thought of give up   god put you here on this eah for a purpose   he want you to enjoy know he and enjoy know other in a very healthy way   we be all in this together   people from the dawn of time have experience deep depression   I love to read the book of psalm when I be feel low or fight a big battle or feel physical pain or have to get right with god or find myself feel like god be far away   sometimes we be just too exhausted to pray   david in the psalm give we the word to pray to god under the bad of circumstance   we can cry out to god like he do and be save from the pit of depression fear aloneness pain trouble and attack by whoever and whatever   so many time we do not understand that we be in a physical attack that have spiual origin   we do not understand that we be spiritual being live in phyiscal body   we can not reject the spiritual    if god be for we who can be against we   satan be still against we   we must fight every day but it be not mean to be such a struggle if we do it in powe we get from god in the person of the holy spirit give to we to be in we to empower we on eah   jesus say that he would not leave we orphan   he would come to we in the person of the holy spirit and never leave we ever   we can count on he for help   how can depression win against he   we must be in his hand and he must be at our side   open the bible and recieve the hope that you need for this life and for eternity   god be not mock and we reap what we sow but if we leave sin behind and come to jesus honestly in repentence of sin and embrace life with he daily seek he we shall be save and our depression will be lift   bit by bit we will see who he be and he will heal we as we seek he day after day in read his word and in prayer   sta read the gospel of john and actsand ask for help from a pastor or believer if you get suck understand some thing but most of all pray as you read the word of god   it be the holy spirit who will become your teacher and you will understand and find great joy and peace in the presence of the live god   he will take away the mourning and give you something to feel like dance about   it be not that tough time will not come   the world be evil and we suffer but if we suffer if we allow god into our life close enought to comfo we and guide we we will have real joy and peace in his presence that be not dependent on our circumstance   sometimes we need special prayer say by spiritually strong man and woman   the power of great faith to perform miracle with the touch of a hand or word come from the power of the holy spirit   there be many ministry that profess to be of god but we be tell in scripture to test the spirit to make sure that it be the holy spirit do teaching and the healing   we can ask for this guidance to know where to go for help and encouragement in our walk with god a ministry that be of god will not teach anything contrary to what be in scripture   never give up   never give up seek god help to keep on fighting to get strong and strong   defeat be just how we learn   sometimes we just need to rest and make some carefully think out life change   god be with you always in the name of jesus

mental healthcare have become horrid in the us one size fit all hospitalization cage as animal wear paper clothing and paper sheet as bed   the mistreatment be bad and more anxiety cause   painful than the illness for I
suicide I know its a personal struggle for everyone be it the people you leave or you do the leaving I think if we have a place we could go and everyone we leave know be we where and new we could come back that would be easy but be lock away be not what help the pain be so excruciating and at its bad you feel like your die anyway and when your at your pretend good its bad because your playing pretend be more than annoy at the person who be go but then imagine they with an illness that be terminal because it be         would you except a terminal person commit suicide

I think this be too vague and complex to be answer in the same catch all way because the human experience be just so different due to perspective I would like to put in my perspective I think people be both right in different way selfish be not the right word however what you be describe be actually someone be inconsiderate they have a disregard for their family and friend feeling in the aftermath they be think only of themselves but on the other hand this inconsiderate thought be not to be blame on the suicidal individual in question most suicidal people do not have the capacity to even think that far ahead the future be bleak and dark and full of seemingly endless pain I have struggle with mental illness my entire life I grow up very poor and a homeless youth during this time I do not even know the thought I have be not normal my mind a physical being have so much pain it be blind I attempt   time not once do I consider go to family or friend I do not have family that love I still do not and I do not have close friend I be sure even if I do I would not have be considerate enough of their feeling to persuade I to stay alive for their benefit alone the internal fight be not about anyone else it be only about you it be a struggle within to overcome pain and heal what be not work by therapy meditation lifestyle fitness yoga meditation etc during this time we have to be selfish we have to be inconsiderate because if we be not we will die decide to live be not for someone else it be not for anyone else benefit it be for I I be not go to decide against kill myself or mutilation because I think my friend will be sad during the time I be consider it all I do not once stop to think huh I wonder how this will affect the world once I be go no instead I learn to live for myself I recently decide I need have more serious treatment and go to a doctor when my dad pass away this february I find out I be bipolar boarding between   I be somewhere in the middle I also have chronic depression and ptsd from extensive childhood abuse I understand more than ever about my suicidal nature and that it be only my battle and that incredible pain you feel be your brain keep you alive it be far too complex to answer this question but it could provide insight to other that it be not an act of selfishness it be an act of inconsideration it be also an act of survival stop call suicidal people selfish they have enough pain weigh they down they already spend every wake moment think thing that would kill a person of less grit and perseverance literally instead what you can do show they you be there for they do not try to pull out information try to understand it all it do not work that way but be there help they eat keep they safe and supervise help they clean up enrich their life by take walk or find small joy make they realize that life be good life be beautiful and people love they even if they do not love themselves but please do not add to their hu by call they selfish you be only push they fuher
I do not believe suicide be selfish if a person have suffer for a long time with the overwhelming depliltate side effect of depressionand medication therapy group therapy hospital stay and ect have not work than why should they have to spend their life suffer to keep other happy
I firmly believe that there should be an option for human euthanasia in case where the person have be treat for a suitable length of time and analyse by different doctor and all other option have be exhaust if the person would still prefer death to the hell they suffer every day in their own mind I think that there should be a mandatory waiting period for they to change their mind or for family member to step up their game on offer actual help the family should be present to say final goodbye alleviate their guilt and also mean no family member will discover the body which be extremely traumatic before a painless euthanasia be perform have this option available may prevent botch suicide attempt which can actually lead to injury that ruin the person life even more
I completely agree as someone who have make attempt on their own life after suffer for year with depression and a fairly recent diagnosis of bpd   the one thing that wind I up in that situation be how everybody tell you how they would feel if you do it guilt you and tell you they be angry   yet the person suffer be not do it for nothing they need suppo
it be never ok I attempt when I be   and I be glad I be still here even in my darkest hour I know I be love deeply by many people who would hu horribly if I try again or succeed I watch my fatherinlaw and sisterinlaw suffer so much when his paner take her life it be still extremely tough for my sisterinlaw who just turn   please seek help when your depression get that bad it may be difficult but you will find the light again
instead of tell someone that if they be suicidal they need to seek out help we should actually be aggressively show these people that we care a truly depressed and suicidal person do not want to ask for help the whole problem be that they feel like a burden the thought of ask for help be out of the question there be too much risk from their perspective no one believe I when I say I be sick when I reach out to people they say I be actually just lazy and selfish and a slob or fake it for attention and in my mind reach out mean that someone might tell I I be all these thing again and in those moment I be not strong enough to handle that so it be safe to not ask for help it be backwards and that be because depression be not logical or reasonable if you see that someone you care about be suicidal you go out of your way to show they that you care and that you want they there do not tell they your friend and family will be sad tell they you will be sad and want to do anything even something small that might prove that you care go to they physically call they and talk to they leave it up to they to ask for help will not work
when you have exhaust all of your option and be still so miserable you would rather die
ian be you talk about your own loss or have you ever experience suicidal thought because these be two different thing entirely and I have never see they treat separately it seem that there be more emphasis on family who have lose a love one but those who have attempt suicide and recover be leftover just like an addict who be expect to be able to keep clean when they leave treatment people like we be expect to go on live but be not give the skill nor the suppo therapy can only go so far that do not often get rid of the thought when a depressive cycle begin it be not like those cycle be only a few day they can last week month and then just as quickly you will be thrust into a manic cycle it be exhaust   also family fail to learn about this disease because they be terrified of it and there be a lot of dysfunction within the family
to feel suicidal be pa of our condition most of we at some point will consider suicide to feel this way be not selfish or cowardly it mean           we need help we need to get well for our self with out the snap out of it for your family guilt which make the self hate a thousand time bad talk to some one hunni x
I do not believe we will ever heal or be cure I believe with self belief and medication we can accept and learn to live with our condition hopefully without judgement and pressure from other
suicide have so much stigmatism to it and when people hear the word they feel like you just assulte someone suicide be never the right answer to temporary problem but it be ultimately your choice no one fully understand when someone be at that point in their life all the doctor visit medicine or counseling will not help if you have reach that point what people do not understand be when someone think or ask about suicide they be look for help even though they deny it they be hope just one person will reach out and help they it be sad because a lot of people say and do so much that the person finally give up because their need be not meet instead of post comment that be negative rude and mean we should reach out to they and see if there be any way we can help suicidal people need love care and understanding in this desperate needtime of life encouragement that be not positive will only fuher their despair
it be not a selfish act it be one of bravery it be the final act in this play we call life the people leave behind feel their own guilt for their own reason
there be nothing selfish about suicide by katie hurley I experience a range of emotion before make peace with the loss but one think that never ever not even for one second cross my mind be this illinformed opinion that suicide be selfish suicide be a lot of thing but selfish be not one of they suicide be a decision make out of desperation hopelessness isolation and loneliness the black hole that be clinical depression be allconsume feel like a burden to love one feel like there be no way out feel trapped and feel isolated be all common among people who suffer from depression people who say that suicide be selfish always reference the survivor it be selfish to leave child spouse and other family member behind so they say they be not think about the survivor or so they would have we believe what they do not know be that those very love one be the reason many people hang on for just one more day they do think about the survivor probably up until the very last moment in many case but the soulcrushing depression that envelop they leave they feel like there be no alternative like the only way to get out be to opt out and that be a devastating thought to endure until you have stare down that level of depression until you have lose your soul to a sea of emptiness and darkness you do not get to make those judgment you might not understand it and you be ceainly entitle to your own feeling but make those judgment and spread that kind of negativity will not help the next person in fact it will only hu other as the world mourn the loss of robin williams people everywhere be leave feel helpless and confused how could someone who appear so happy in actuality be so very depressed the truth be that many many people face the very same struggle each and every day some will commit suicide some will attempt and some will hang on for dear life most will not be able to ask for the help that they need to overcome their mental illness
it be never ok ever the familyfriend leave behind will be scarred for life suicide be a selfish act there be resource reach out to they not every day be a good day not every day be a bad one either the struggle be real the fight be hard find your resource and keep go it might be exhausting but keep go anyway do not ever be afraid to ask for help keep go right ciara mary voelker
you and your selfish horrible comment should not be on this kind of site absolutely disgusting comment you should be ashamed of yourself you horrible person
becky bergmann voelker   I wish you and your daughter the good but please listen and understand when other tell you not to throw around suicide be selfish that statement be cause by ignorance often the person have the good of intention and want to help in any possible but until you be live year with a mental illness that you do not ask for then and only then can you realize how deeply the mind be at war you can have the good suppo family friend and resource to help your suicidal thought but you be constantly fight your mind feel like you will be a burden if you do seek help selfish have nothing to do with it seek help be a struggle and yes as you say everyone deserve help but for many it be not the clear cut choice it be not simple to choose help when your mind be tell you the world would be a well place without you please continue to become educate on mental health in order to stop from fuher spread stigma most people I have talk to who have struggle with suicidal thought myself include think that if they do give into their thought then they will be do other a favor it be a cruel battle between thought and action
suicide be not selfish to think about or even do it the entire point of suicide be that you want to end your pan and not put those around you in pain the pain of you be around yes it be pa of mental illness I know I have anxiety I have depression I have bipolar and they be severe I be in treatment I be on medication and I still have the suicidal thought and suicidal tendency so do my fiance so to sit there and say that   anyone who do not seek help ithat do not make they selfish for all you know they could be seek treatment so no it be not and I repeat not a selfish thing and it be very upsetting to say that it be a selfish thing and the fact that they be talk about it and they be ask if and when it be okay that be their way of asking and of get help so why do not you try put yourself in someone else shoe before you say they be be selfish because unless you have the illness and you can stand and walk in that mindset a hundred percent of the time you will never understand it not fully

why be it we be in a group base on suppo and we be focus on how someone be be selfish for commit suicide do none of you make that comment realize the mind set the person have to be in already to make that life alter decision they do not currently care about their own existence yet you be expect their mind to stop and concern with other after they take themselves from the pain and misery they feel currently that be not the way to talk to someone with severe depression contemplate suicide   they need someone to listen someone to talk to and someone to be there they need to feel understood hear and love and that this will get well or that they be not alone struggle with this   do not insist they focus on other issue when they have such drastic mental issue go on in their own mindset that they have difficult contemplating decision already especially to use word like selfish when you fully clearly do not understand the extend one have to be to be that desperate to make that choice even if you do view it as selfish or not it be a misunderstanding on your end not theirs and you be speak out of be hu by other action you do not fully understand because you could not help they

julie barron this I remember my mother persistently say it be selfish and I would fall fuher down the rabbit hole my brother on the other hand would say no here be something you can live for why do not we wait until this moment and then see how you feel then and his approach be far more helpful than guilt be
I be never try to guilt they out of the thought more ask they to think about the people around they everybody have somebody who care dearly for they even if they do not feel that way

look into have your med adjust try some positive stress relief music color bead garden move around   get some sun just get keep try till you find what help
talk to your pdoc I agree with suggestion that either a new med or dose might be need if you be not try other cope skill or in therapy med can only go so far motherhood be hugely stressful and therapy be necessary for I I have   kid   all with various issue and some with serious diagnosis too I take time for I or I can not stay well daily meditation and a dedicated sleep schedule be critical
I hate zoloft though it never do that to I I be on what be call an offlabel drug mean the pill be mean for one thing but they notice in patient it be also help with anxiety I have be on mgs of lamotrigine and very little side effect and no weight gain for sleep insomnia I use trazadone it be actually for depression and I be happy with these
what be your dosage on your zoloft I have be on it since   staed at   now up too mg I also take zanex and colozopan for anxiety
its hard when we hide our symptom make it hard for even the good suppo system to know they need to intervine I still do it though survive the aftermath take an honest self assesment accept your acheivement limitation    your ablitie build from there do not stress on what your sickness have cause you re well now educate people on your symptomatic behavior   some helpful respose   it can take week or month for I to bounce back completely keep you re mind occupid set small goal celebrate every accomplishment even the tinest baby step   be patient with yourself
often time a lot of people go through that so you be not alone I would seek out a counselor to be able to talk to someone it will help you may have to find one you like well but once you do you will find yourself be able to open up more I get paranoid about thing sometimes and think someone be go to say something so I keep my mouth close but therapy have help I in the past I wish you the good of luck
as far as the before and after I get to the after with my wellness recovery action plan a wrap this be absolutely online and there be an iphone app for it too I keep a bullet journal of task but thought too and I rate myself   on anxiety depression psychotic feature   if I flip back and see my rating and thought get bad I try to intervene why I be healthy
last psychotic episode I take I be hear thing I be convince the guy upstairs have drill hole in ceiling and to spy on I and I could see writing appear on wall I be sit in dark hall way hide terrify to move for hour until my son come home he know something be wrong with I   but it all seem very real to I until the hospital explain what be happen   I be put on medication to stop hallucination for a few week and opt to go home with a cpn popping in every day for a week to check on I   scary stuff at time but with suppo of my son I get through it x
often the people around I have no clue unless my hand get shaky or I be pace and talk fast at that point they assume I be high on something I be I I let they assume what they may getting pull over be no fun though these thing be misinterpret as be high or have something to hide well yea I be hide my anxiety as well as I can   for my shakiness I take a benzo this help to merely slow the physical pas but not the mind as much for the mind I be learn to be more aware of the trigger and not respond so quick to it
or in the case of my husband switch during the dayi get tired of be christopher robin sometimes it be hard when I do not know which one I be talk to my stress have be pretty high lately we have always be pretty open about his bipolar so I tell he he need to tell I who I be talk to so I be prepare
I get panic attack
I be go through the consequence now I know how you feel   I seem to push people awayafraid they be go to leave or give up on I anyway   I have learn a lot about myself be a loner though but if it be friend you seek have you try talk to any of they some of they may have be wait on you to say hello   you may have burn a bridge but what be tear down can be rebuild with time effo patience and love
I want to add that my mother have bipolar challenge whereby I could not give her suppo and live in fear of experience her harmful episode   she would think she have stae feeling well and therefore stop she medicationsthen downward she would go   this be a good teacher I always take my med   and basically speak I run fairly balance much much well but still need to pay close attention
people be self center manny do not realise what they have do even I could have hu some one the problem be I do not know I would like to think I have not but if some one tell I I have I would be live then you never know what action can really hu some one eal and I honestly be live we be all guilty of this in one way or another maybe not intentional
they do not realise that they have hu you and keep do it but I think that it be my fault too because of my insecurity   
my son be the same I give he benadryl when it be bad it work really well for anxiety and put you to sleep his dr say it be fine to use
I do not know if they will prescribe it where you be but I take hydroxyzine at night for my anxiety as it get pretty bad throughout the night I can also take it during the day as need
my teenage daughter be prescribe celexa and buspar depression and anxiety
not ssris because there be an increase risk of suicide in teen when they be on they
both my teen boy take prozac and trazadone antianxiety that also aid in sleep   both boy be asd melatonin cause night terror   after   year of no sleep the doctor finally put they these med   quality of life and sleep have improve in the whole house
my son be   and take buspar for anxiety you only take it as need and his doc have no problem prescribe it   I want to give you my   cent I be definitely not against medication I take several and so do my   year old but be very very aware of the side effect of antidepressant and antipsychotic I see a lot of suggestion in the comment for fairly heavy duty psych med and I feel you only want to take those as a last reso seroquel and remeron so on etc etc be serious med and I have be on they as an adult and would never put my child on they unless he have actual psychosis they be both huge weight gainer that effect the metabolism you do not want to sta mess with his metabolism so young they also be extremely sedate and not just at night they can have a big zombie effect they also mess with the body ability to control it be core temperature they be also link to severe oral issue rotten brittle tooth etc   obviously if you have to have med then you have to have med but make sure you study any drug before let he sta take it
do he drink a lot of caffeine caffeine be a stimulant and will make anxiety bad limit caffeine   hour before bedtime a body pillow maybe with your mom clothe scent on it I find something solid in bed with I that be comforable help if its possible or if you have not   already try it a critter like a dog might help make he feel safe in his own room I would be careful with the melatonin though because prolong use will make it less effective I be use valarian root right now which be also suppose to help with anxiety chamomile tea be great you could also try st johns wo but as with any medication check to make sure its not go to interfere with anything else if he s take other med good luck
my teen take remeron miazapine to sleep our pdoc be also reluctant to prescribe antianxiety med or sleep aid and this be a good compromise she have awful nightmare due to ptsd and severe anxiety she also take prazosin to help with the nightmare we also use the calm app for sleep but otherwise no screen before bed no tv and we be careful about caffeine and sugar in a house full of anxious insomniac we be vigilant parent
as an aside my little    and   do not sleep due to night terror and anxiety and melatonin and meditation app be all we be do no doctor here would give they anything else pure parental suffering and no sleep for ten year they be get well with time but it be be rough I feel for your mom
yes teen can be give medication I know in the state doctor do it as young as   it be not a bad thing to have to take medication the only downside be addiction to it or even depression that can follow I have severe anxiety and I have be on medication for year I would also seek out something to get his anxiety down while he sleep it be tough being on sleep medication but with racing thought in your head will not go away therapy may also be a good thing to seek out you may want to try that first if it do not succeed then I would look to other alternative also your mum   could go to therapy to talk to someone about how she feel it be not a bad thing at all therapy can change the whole world to a person I wish you and your family the well good luck in find the right answer because they be out there
or you can look up the medicine in the internet and show your mom which will allow she to learn about the medication if it would be helpful for he the side effect and if there be any risk associate with the medication
seroquel be an antipsychotic that help one relax when it come to anxiety and fight the paranoia of become anxious I myself be diagnose with bipolar disorder depression ptsd and anxiety get out of bed everyday be most of the time a struggle I have be on seroquel for   year andye there have be time where we have to either lower my dose or increase it some but it have work especially for my insomnia it help I fall asleep stay asleep and most of the time I wake up feeling refresh and calm which be so rewarding yes I be   year old but I have a daughter who be prescribe the same medication when she be   and it be very effective for she also plus it be not addict and it do not because you to be dependant on it there be day that I can go to bed without it and I be fine plus it might help enough to where it can be a sho term medication and he will possibly learn and develop a routine to fall asleep and wake up in his own bed it be woh a shot and I hope it help ps I live in the usa but maybe since you have be inform of this medication and know it be safe for kid and teen with little to no side effect it can be discuss with your brother dr they both need some relief so maybe if he deny it look into another dr who be willing to try to give your brother the help he need and your mom the peace and rest she and she both need maybe one who see that this be a problem in which they be willing to try to help fix and correct good luck and good wish from the usa
most teen be able to take med and they be safe for they they do not put they on stuff like xanax because that be sho term anxiety relief and can have substance abuse and dependency issue most child and teen with anxiety be put on antidepressant and they be long term and super effective I have be take antidepressant since I be twelve I be   now and they help a lot you have to figure out which medication work well and do not have side effect for he   I be on wellbutrin   but there be other type of med out there hope this help   
have he see a psychologist for some talk therapy they can help work out why he be anxious and give he strategy to deal with it medication may help but I would say that most med have not be test as safe for kid I do know that ssris make my anxiety worse
I do not know who you be    we also share very simular illness in our family     you be doung exactly the right thing by rwache out     you be obviously very strong         tell yourself I be strong     tell yourself you love youeself       you ar not a burden       I oove my sister struggle and all    god bless you

bobbi nicole sullivan sorry I be kind of a zyprexa fanboy I just think it be a really good med with mild side effect but get a bad rap because of the possible weight gaindiabete risk I do not know when you have get bipolar disorder schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder pretty much any med they will give you be go to suck in some way unfounately you just get to figure out which set of side effect suck the least for you personally I can not handle the creepycrawly restless limb stuff or tremor I will take the possible weight gain any day of the week but hey maybe I will be change my tune if the zyprexa give I diabete haha
call a crisis line as soon as possible to get help or call   to go to er to the psych ward to get help have do it do not be afraid they have do lot of help
no easy answer   you do what be good for you do not expect they to understand do not care if they do it be where self acceptance come into play and since I have learn it I have blow off some and go to other why   because I know it come down to my decision not what other expect or want I to do   I lie with someone for   year that want I at every little event as they be very outgoing this be   time a week I literally make myself miserable and break down because I be not meet their expectation when I realize I only have to meet my own expectation and gauage they on how I feel I be progress it have be night and day truly I go to way more thing now then   ever have before that be not to say it be a lot but it be the very impoant thing I also dread they far less and typically enjoy myself athough of course the smal the get together the well lol

I ovehink all the time I analyze everything sometimes I really believe that when I ovehink everything I become my own bad enemy as much as we want to turn the brain off it be not an easy thing to do at all I have try many time but fail at it I also understand the shower thing last week I have not shower or change my clothe in day and that include brush my hair I be not proud of this fact but it happen my own smell finally become too much to handle and I shower the funny thing be after the shower I feel amazing be in the shower feel amazing but the hard pa in those day be get myself to the shower depressionbi polar suck after yrs of marriage I just find out a couple of day ago that my husband be cheat with some woman well it be be a few woman online and now my marriage be over I do not doubt my depression help push he to someone else as on my low day I must have be so hard to deal with and unless your paner understand depression or have be around it or have a family member suffer from it they have no idea how to handle our high and low the mood swing be out of control sometimes and if I can barely cope with how I be feel how do I expect he or anyone else to understand what it be like life be crappy my future be crappy and all man be lie cheat pig but hey that be life just because everyone else be hard on you do not be hard on yourself heasuit
totally understand everyday be a battle I have the same here a pay to go to people I dearly want to see invite to dinner all lovely thing with lovely people but its a battle just think about go   let alone actually go   do try if you can   I try and when people do not understand I I simply say thank goodness I hope they never have to   at the moment I have have my medication change and its send my head into a turmoil   worry and ovehinke they   its all these thing that be catastrophize by we but be small thing to other   good luck I hope you can muster up the energy xx
I have actually be here and know exactly how you feel   keep climb those mountain   I have realize by this point I simply have major limitation   I do not even try to force it anymore   if the idea of paicipate   be overwhelming I simply do not do it   if I force myself to do thing I do not want to I would be majorly trigger   say no I be sorry I can not be one of the most empowering phrase I have learn to master   I have never have a friend that do not understand it redhea
I completely understand it take I   hour to talk myself into a shower today even though I have not shower since friday morning then it take I   hour to talk myself into grocery shopping and have a panic attack in the store manage to pull it together to finish then have a panic attack drive home and be drench in sweat and so panicked I could not get out of my car right away when I get home   I would not know how to act if I do not over think everything
take I   hrs to get to the store today too and then I also have a panic attack while I be there nice to know I be not alone

when I get hypo mania I have get so much energy for day and day I do not sleepi do not eati do not need to   I can not stay still I fidget to much I talk way too fast I be super social around other people I do not have to pretend to be happy   it be awsome   for I   the   most scary thing of all be when I be come down from that massive high   it happen in a split second then I turn into this furious ball of evil anger the voice and the noise get so loud in my head that I can not stop they I can not control they they will not shut up then depression come back and hit   million time hard than before its not fun its actually really scary not be able to control myself and not remember what I have do or say
I struggle just to sit still
mania be great as hypo mania for the first   day energy no sleep clean like mad then sta the babble the irritated rant anger no patience want to hit fury break anything finally thought of suicide this be fun   I think not
I actually love be manic I get lot do I have energy I be more open to human interaction I get along with people well it be so great for I but I know that eventually I be go to crash so hard that be what I hate about it the constant dread of when be that next swing go to hit the only time I do not like mania be when I be in a mixed episode angry so full of negative energy and too depressed to release it safely but it be different for everyone I can see why some people would dislike it
restless pace relentless plan make ruminate insomnia rehash and compulsive impulse drive not a fun thing at all
true that mania be often time look at as be high high typically conjure up thought of enjoyment it be fun and exciting when it be ramp up but the fun go away fairly quickly the excitement stay but not it be not a good excitement feeling of invincibility delusion overinflate sense of self irritability reckless behavior and a really sho fuse for those who dare get in the way of the going on in our life our life be the thing we be do when manic take over the world build rocket to fly to space figure out the equation for time travel and in our spare time submit to an overindulgence in anything we love do do I mention reckless behavior if not add reckless behavior to the list before I forget reckless behavior that be just the euphoric mania then come the shame and guilt of the loss of impulse control overcommitte ourselves to friend family employer and customer burn through cash pay for our overindulgence and the frustration of have to get catch up on the thing that really matter which of course by the time we have our mental faculty restore be leave completely exhausted and have no energy to do any of it mania be a dangerous condition   then there be dysphoric maniai be not even go to sta that one most of my manic episode be dysphoric let we just say that dysphoric mania be extremely destructive
my mania be angry mania its awfulout of control anger at everyone and everything its well now that I be on med but its horrid when it happen its embarrassingit scary for my familyoh the fun of bipolarit just grand
and it be not the same as anxiety
yeah I love the pa where I be so high and I believe god have give I a special power and I feel amazingly in touch with everything however when my body can not keep up with my brain anymore and I sta to get close to fall then I really get aggravate and anxious
I be in that mode at the moment it be so scary
I get hypomania but I dread to think how life would be with mania
this be how I use to feel   I thank god that these horrible time be shoer now   I believe grow old and have more insight into my bipolar disorder and my severe anxiety and depression have help I immensely as well as live with a very kind suppoive individual who believe in I
feel right now to the point my old yell at I I hate you you be not my mom and you never be I wish I could explain the uncontrollable thought in my head why I cry bc they hu explain why I need space before I do bad how to explain to a yoalmost    do not even want to leave home to go to work but I be here now and I do not want to do anything but cry
reach out only if sincere our paranoia let we we see through bullshit
go through a shitty day and afraid to say it to my friend be out but it do not do much good
iback in the s I be put on benzo to help anxiety and I become addicted over year of use   they do mostly help but they make I so tired all the time I could not perform my daily duty at home or elsewhere   I be teach different breathing technique and sometimes it work but sometimes it do not   sometimes a good distraction help calm a person down   it be be over   year now and it be definitely improve most day   it be differant for every person who deal with this   just try to do the good you can no one in your life should be ask for anything more out of you than try to do your good
yeah you just wish anxiety would go away   but what do not help   be what cause it will not go asay
yeah you just wish anxiety would go away   but what do not help   be what cause it will not go asay
sometimes it be a big voice use all your insecurity against you
be the mother watch be horrible too no matter who its be it be not a picnic for sure
I take welbuterin   for depression and anxiety and noryptaline for sleep lose some weight   from welbuterin
every antidepressant I have try I have always gain weight on unfounately it be a site effect on most of the tablet they give you I be no long on medication as nothing work and now struggle to loose the   stone I have gain since be on bloody med
this be all interesting I work for year with people with mental health issue and realize I have they myself it really be easy to help other people than face those issue within one self I take med for bi polar get fat then stop drank and get fatter stop drink as well I be into my th year now I staed take melatonin to sleep   high blood pressure pill and water pill now I have to work on my weight and get it back down the hard pa be get a mind set to set up a well routine   eat well and exercise morei know with the client I use to work with keep ongoing record be a valuable tool because you can see the result and work on routinepeople do much well with routine and organize home clutter make people nuts I know this because I live with the people I work with   day on   day off   I and my alternate work well together keep thing organize and schedule everyone go to bed by   and up between   or   depend on client ability
I take effexor and klonipin and have for a long time I be able to get the weight issue even out after about   month and truly do not think it affect I much anymore it be be over a decade since I staed with they just fyi drink with benzodiazepine can be dangerous and withdrawal from alcohol and benzo be both very dangerous and usually need to detox medically alcohol withdrawal be often treat with benzo to decrease risk of seizure so please be careful
yes I be almost   week sober again technically I have be diagnose with bipolar and general anxiety I have horrible pm they have have I on different cocktail of about   mental health drug at the same time I stop drink a couple week ago I stop all my med except   mg celexa I be on   and xanax as need I be try to see what happen without all the drug I feel mood stabilizer make I bad and I feel alcohol be my bad trigger good luck

yeah so I do not know about med but I know I like take ashwaghanda root for depression and valerian root as a sedative and a sleep aid also thc free cbd oil as well for anxiety
I agree with jennifer tenhagen a therapist do not diagnose however the bad thing anyone who suffer from a mental illness or any form of illness have the tendency to look it all up that play trick with your mind the good way to bring it up be to see a psychiatrist and do all the test when you finish they then they can give you the correct diagnosis you may have anxiety and not adhd that be why a doctor need to diagnose you I hope you the good I be diagnose in
what jennifer tenhagen have post be very accurate so please take note of her advice as many people get confuse your therapist have treat you very appropriately as only a psychiatrist can or should diagnose any medical disorder a therapist play a very different yet valuable role
I use to have all these feeling like everybody else I be read these post and I travel back in my mind to feel this way for so many year I have be slowly get my old self back my old life before I be over medicated and live in board and care home and constantly go in and out of psych hospital I would pray and dream for my life back my dream be come true and I have be more than stable for   year yes I have struggle but I be strong now mentally please believe it when I say there be hope and I be proof
but I never feel happy I live in brokenhome so I get confused with I want to be happy again or I want to be the old I
the struggle be real
I wake every morning with anxiety wonder how I be go to cope with my day that be what get to I
I just read that lithium have be approve for pregnancy the risk to the fetuss hea be not what they think
talk to your doctor about what the risk be as this be your baby and you want the good
I be on mg prozac and   mg rispedol when I be pregnant my anxiety be horrible pm I if you have any question
you should release your anxiety because it sound like your thought be race scrubcleanbench press sprint run get aggression out and get that air in your lung feel life your woh something your not wohless we can do it you can make it just push till tomorrow and keep push
this make perfect sense to I   the thing that should be okay thing I have experience a hundred time without harm still create utter panic
brendan fry because you overplayed disturbed version
I have be on both I find they very much the same in term of anxiety control they help to stabilise my mood somewhat but neither one be great I find the seroquel make I super drowsy to the point that I be a useless lump of a human being with no drive to do anything however my paner be on seroquel and he be have no side effect and it be help he a lot   the zyprexa make my appetite insatiable and my metabolism stop so I gain kgs in   month   I have now be put on ziprasidone and it be a life saver I have find its the good medication I could go on I have not have any side effect from it in the   month I have be on it but everyone be different and medication be trial and error
seroquel help I so much with my anxiety it be the only thing that ever help I get off benzo as well it have most definitely save my life
yeah I mean I be on it   year before this but I have the xr version and I think it be well if you have that one but the regular seroquel be scary give I panic attack and dude that be really scary I be sorry that happen to you glad your mom be there to help
get off the seroquel while you can horrible drug
I use seroquel as a sedative because I have sleep issue insomnia and I have lexapro an antidepressant to counter act the depressive side effect of seroquel and to help I w my anxiety and depression it work fine w I I take mgs every night   pm and I would be asleep by   I use to take only mgs and it kind of make you immune to the sleep effect so my dosage get high haha hope this help   also seroquel make I lose a lot of weight I do not know why
also seroquel relax I when I have anxiety attack   it really help I calm down
I gain a huge amount of weight I be tired all the time and have terrible nightmare and night terror so thankful to be off it
I have gain a ton of weight but the benefit out weigh my weight currently I be on   but I have on as much as   whitch make really tired and unable to function it take away my nightmare and night terror
my husband take serequel for anxiety but he also have schizoeffective disorder
and they be very dangerous when come off benzodiazepine one should really do a medical detox for risk of seizure most put one on phenobarbitol for it
really my husband take   mg not much I guess so that make I nervous
both of these medication can cause anxiety and depression they be very strong antipsychotic drug use they for anxiety be comparable to use heroin for a headache anxiety can be tame with a class of med from benzodiazepine or even antihistamine you may also find relief from cognative behaivor learn trigger and cope skill with out medication   we must all be careful of how medication be use and perscribe to we
same here thora have be on mg of zoloft for just over a year up from mg since september    I take it for both mdd and social anxiety though more so for the anxiety these day it be be a lifesaver
perhaps both be true   maybe your memory have be alter due to time and the deep emotion that go with something like this and they also do not want all you say to be true because it be shameful and it hu   the truth be likely somewhere in the middle   I think in make peace if you take the position that you be a child and some of the memory could be a little skewed however insist that neveheless it have ceainly contribute to your current state   this might be a well place to sta reconciliation   anywaythat be my two centsgod bless you
o how I can relate I too go throw this same exact scenario watch my alcoholic step dad beat my mom when I be a small child till this day I be tell it be untruei know what I see I have always be tell anything that I remember as a child it be just my imagination it be horrible to think the one person in life that bihe you tell you you be pretty much delusional I have learn to detach myself from my upbringing for I think and be make to feel it be all a lie hope you find peace with it
I can relate and this memory issue be not uncommon perhaps you would do well to focus on store those memory somewhere where they can no long effect you or confuse you yrs be such a long time to be deal with this maybe   put all that negative energy that will juzt keep you sick into let it go this enable I to move forward   focus on my day to day health   wellbee
brian castaneda I be so proud of everything you have do that be bring you to where you be today you deserve recognition for your struggle hardship and success in that
please get help hon there be no shame in seek help I agree stay away from judgemental people and those that know nothing about mental illness
I go to a center for mental health and substance abuse place for either or both issue which be the real beginning of get myself under control they have counselor who I find be non judgmental not pushy and there for you to talk anytime they have a huge range of resource and suppo all type group meeting with people deal with similar issue they help you to understand yourself more and come up with solution that be right for you it be always a good idea to talk to your doctor or a psychiatrist but I find the mental health center to be the good suppo you be in control it be all about try new thing a good try keep what be good pass on what be not for you you can do it I know it be overwhelming and it be hard to get a ball rolling but it will get well and you will enjoy life as you find yourself moreredhea
I know exactly how you feel I be the same and do not bother at time talk to anyone include my paner I do not think people realize it be just a struggle to even get out of bed sometimes I do not think you should drop your paner try and sit down and tell he exactly how you feel if he love you he will do some research   or buy a book to understand the illness avoid the judgemental   unknowledgeable    people see if there be group out there who have the same illness as you so they can relate to how you be feel these people understand so good for your soul seek professional help to see if you be on the right med avoid negativity in general or zone out if you can not avoid they
I decide to be open about my bipolar disorder and some remain wary but I do not carei will not shrink from this I be not embarrassed and by be open I believe I be make a small contribution to the understanding of   it
I be not feel very well   I be struggle with my anxietydepressionptsd today everyone think I have a stomach bug or some shit
I understand sometimes what be say or post be not helpful if you have a diagnosis please do not be ashamed as I be god make we and give we thing to make we strong if you be on med take they faithfully maybe this be your test in trust and faith
this be regressive towards mental health people like myself do not choose to have this illness and not all misery need company sometimes company need misery
I do not like to call it a darkness personallyjust a place of indecision for I
I be on abilify for a mood stabilizer I be on zoloft for anti depressant and klonopin for anxiety I be bipolar ll all during my pregnancy and my son be perfectly healthy     I go to massachusetts general hospital in boston ma for advice on what to take that would be safe for baby
this would drive I crazy it would make my anxiety worse
that would just make my anxiety bad I hate any type of restrainment
I suffer from bad anxiety   this would be great   question where can you find they and be they too heavy in the heat
  hour sometimes be not enough when my anxiety sta I will not leave the house
I have to go somewhere tomorrow and I be already feel anxious
if I be healthy and do not have tie here I would move in a heabeat   I do not share the same ideal as our president nor do I believe strip the health insurance from   million of america most vulnerable citizen to give america most wealthy a giant tax break be in the least bit humane or acceptable   it would be more humane to line the sick and elderly up against the wall and shoot they
sylvester be look a bit stress out lol
I doubt anyone be happy she be be go and they would not be if you be they be all just try to cope with their own grief if they can justify her death by say that she no long suffer it can help dull the pain and confusion they feel inside
I be not confused that I love youhehehethank yo
failure and fear be my problem
brenda benefield thank you that be advice from the doctor   anxiety turn into excruciating muscle spasm and seizurelike episode that last for hour medication and therapy be a necessity also but you have to help yourself find out about all the symptom of manic dep so you can win some battle you will never win the big war but accept the battle that you win as something learn I ve write research paper   and help therapist on way to come up out of depression if you be interested it will work for you god be with all of you hug to all
for I the last thing I need be some make up bull shit about how god love I and we can not go on will you   it be the misconstrue lie that make I fall fuher away   this mental cage be a burden we place upon ourselves be a spiral spin the fuck out   if you love this person and I be guess you do spend quality time   make they feel they matter   this hole be deep   contemplation overwhelm we to the point of oblivion   sometimes the good answer be silence along with companionship along with a smile   this monkey be a bitch dude
bobbi nicole sullivan from my perspective yes madam   drive I into a pit that I can not climb fast enough to get away from   depression and anxiety go hand in hand with each other   for I anyway
bobbi nicole sullivan yes all this for anxiety too much or too little for you
jesse be correct on the crippling effect anxiety can have   a lot of time the simple gesture to show you care be the one that help the most
bobbi every person be different with different need sometimes anxiety andor depression can stop I from really do anything for myself social anxiety may not want to leave the house so it can be helpful to have a suppo network of close friend etc to help out if it get so bad
yeah if you want to get pregnantthat will sure change tomorrow no doubt

so many story about depression and anxiety no one say what to do to get well   
what should I do I feel like there be nothing that would make I happy anymore I do not care about anything anymore nothing excite I I have no motivation the only reason I do not sleep all my life be because I have uncomfoable pillow which I be afraid to change they with comfoable one I feel so drained and emptyplease anybody tell I something a new perspective a reason to live to breath I want to cry but I cont even see point in do that

latuda cause I to get akithesia severe restlessness to the point I could not stand sit or lie down for even a few minute at a time and I try it twice as it have staed to help my mood go on   year and still can not find a med to stabilize my bipolar
latuda be horrible for I and listen to your body how you feel only you know
latuda have a terrible effect on I I feel shaky but like a zombie at the same time almost like a bouncy ball stick in a glass cup I could not function or let alone drive on it everyone react differently though I would say try it out for a few week if you can and then talk to your doctor I have find that the first few week of take a new medication have always be difficult because of the initial side effect
trintellix cause seizure the side affect be horrible my psychiatrist prescribe it for I but I do not take it I have toughe it out for   week go back next week   but I be also on another med for my bi polar
I just message this page privately and still await a reply I be honestly stuck and confused I need immediate help that be if abuse be an emergency

latuda be bad for I   zombie weight gain throw up if I do not take it precisely a half hour after eat paranoia and a general just wrong and off feel it put I to sleep like the dead within minute and I be so tired all day I could not even stay awake
latuda give I horrible side different for everyone be the bad for I of all med I have try
be on   mg for about a year I really do not notice a difference I be hope it would help but make sure you take it after you eat because with I it can upset the stomach pretty bad and I be tell it do not even work unless you take it with at least   calorie
latuda the next morning I sawfelt the wall move when I lay in my mom bed and staed at the ceiling super scary to see wall of a house shape shift etc never take it again

ohhhhh beautifultalente funny robin so sadly badly miss from our world so clever you be at wear the happy mask   I can so totally relate on all level   such a wickedly horrid thing be depressionanxiety and such   and sadly for robin a fight that he could no long endure will never ever be forget for the happy he give our soul redhea
so sad no one could save he he probably have no one he could talk to about his illness for fear of be label as a stigma in society   god be the only one that can judge we be not suppose to judge other lest ye be judge thy self
true story   your body feel so heavy and when your stress out it get bad and bad until you can hardly stand it  
my husband always ask I why I be so tired all time time why do you need to nap everyday or go to bed by   only if we could switch body and mind for a day so the unknowing one could then understand what depression anxiety the panic attack so bad you have to pull over for be all about not to mention have social anxiety and be diagnose with bipolar disorder ughhh
that be how I feel when I sleep I do not feel the anxiety and panic attack I just can not get enough sleep sometime completely no energy specially with the med I take make I have no energy exercise help when I force myself it be hard and depressing
this be I right now struggle a lot and my only respite be sleep   
yes I have hide my anxiety and depression for year I never talk about it I suffer in silence and feel so alone I do not apologise for it anyway more
people ju make one guilty n feel   time bad
the only way it work with my husband be he educate himself on the disorder before I he have no idea what be bpd he need to have patience and to respect your space and you respect his space we can be overwhelming sometimes and for someone that do not have a disorder can be pretty hard to understand good luck xox
maybe have this person read about your disorder and explain an every day situation so they have example tell they how you be when you be upset like say thing you do not mean wait for a reaction maybe punch a wall and give they a little advice on how they can help in the situation and the easy way to prevent a problem in the future between you two
so the cool thing be that you can listen to the bird in the morning without rush off to work I be afraid that be all I get for positive anything
unfounately yes it be a struggle every day to get myself to believe I be wohy and do ok and this be on my med before I find this combo of drug I feel exactly the same as you   and it do not matter how many people tell I I be special I hate myself and the last time I be sick I have to quit a job I have work hard to get and have work towards for over   year   which now I regret and wish I have be able to cope and be normal then so I could keep work there now I do not have a job we barely scrape by and I feel so guilty that my illness cause this   anyway so sorry you be feel this way I understand completely where you be come from so I be not go to tell you to buck up as I know you can not   I be just go to say I understand and I care
yes I do be try for   yrs to shake the horrible feeling I have about myself need a new dr
I feel the same when my anxiety set in and I can not do anything like clean the house I feel like a failure because I be not able to do all the thing normalpeople do
yeah I feel that way everyday   I avoid mirror and camera because they always seem to see the sad pa of I I hate not feel normal and it seem like no one understand that   and when I teach out for help because I feel like I be have s mental breakdown in tell I can not have one because I have a family that need mebut how do you stop it
I have have bipolar one for   year and adhd for year I be now   year young I too struggle with self hate I have never be normal and I have be bully all throw my school I often get really down just think   that I will have these disease s for the rest of my life but then I try to b positive and just take one day st a time hang in there these bad feeling do not last forever                 
do you have a psychiatrist as far as I know only they can give you the diagnosis I too have childhood anxiety however I also have borderline personalitybut once I go to college I be pretty sure that I have bipolar I take my concern to a psychiatrist and within our first appointment and a series of question I meet the criterion lynn be righti have have long period of depression as well as mania I also rapid cycle often some day my mood can change in a snap but do get your gp refer you to a psychiatrist I wish you luck
I be here for you to talk to anytime its scary I know
hi I have the same thing and the same thought I break down and try to kill myself with my dad gun before get help I be admit to impatient ward and be there for   day after get out I do a out patient for   week it change my life I have never be so happy if you know you need help do not wait just go your gut be always right go and get help
when I be stress out and thing be go well I take a day off and do nothing I take a hot bath I watch a good movie eat a good meal my favorite food suite or whatever it be and I do not think about anything and just relax and sleep maybe that be what you need to do be just relax take a couple deep breath and enjoy your day
that be a lot to go through in a sho period of time ceainly   you have go through a lot of emotional trauma as well as abandoment issue   I would be quite hesitant if a doctor diagnose some one at the age with a bipolar or even many other mental illness the reason be because for one pubey ceainly have not hit at that young of an age other reason would be that we learn emotional reaction from our environment which in turn mean we can learn well cope skill   by no means be I say there be nothing wrong simply that it be woh look at thing from a different angle
nobody even want to try and understand my work be especially close and cold heaed with those of we that have illness and be not a pa of their click they ignore I and treat I as an obstacle they have to constantly avoid
there be one person in the whole world my friend trust he mock she call her unmentionable name call her stupid you name it I have to talk to she for three hour to convince she not to leave this world so please anxiety and bipolar be no joke they do not ask to be bear with it
thank you for say that I feel so helpless for my friend she be a beautiful person and so broken right now call someone nasty name and be healess when there confuse scared and feeling lose be not ok
you need to involve your mom in your treatment my momfamily do not get it until I take take they to family counseling and to group counseling specifically for family deal with someone with my disorder you can not be upset if they truly know nothing about what be go on if they know then they could see how great you be do
I totally understand no one will understand mental illness because it scare the shit out of they for I I be always remember for all the mistake I make or for one sister do not believe in my diagnosis she also resent my go on disability my brother have a wife who can not stand I and he think that every time I call he I be try to ask he to bail I out again thing I do before I get diagnose and get on medication but he still judge I and see I as that other person he be the one person who I think would sta to understand bpd because he get read material I suggest but it do not matter my whole family and history be pretty crazy ya know so after my first suicide attempt I think that I have really burn some bridge the only one that have be there through it all have be my sister nancy I can not tell you how much we have grow I make a decision to move away from my family so that I could learn to stand on my own two foot while it have be a bumpy ride it have be the right thing to do I have a companion in my life who I be learn to love freely and in turn learn to love myself   my advice to you try to find your own way in the world and people who will love you exactly as you be your family be never go to change so except it and move on you be an amazing person for the journey and the obstacle you have overcome sta to separate from your family there be a world out there that be so amazingly beautiful you just have to take that step
I wad the drug addict and the one with mental health problem and with both I be tell that I be try to get even with my dad for leave we when we be young that I just want attention that there be nothing wrong with I other than try to get my way   it be all because mental health scare people in my opinion they do not understand it so they blame the person wroth the disease
my mum tell I I be an embarrassment and no one in the family want to be around I fuck they
you be amazing your struggle be real and you have come far   I kno its not the same but I want you to hear it at least once tonight I have be be you be as far as not get the credit for the work you have do just to survive I be a cutter as a teen and I relapse when I be like   and   when my mom find out she tell I I be do it to hu she even though I be tre to hide it   when your mom go off on how well your sibling be do walk in the bathroom put the phone down for just a second put your hand on your hip and hold your head high look in the mirror and say I be a fking super hero and kno that you be and pick the phone back up
you can still love and suppo someone without have to be with they if that be what you choose to do but I think at this point it would be too sudden to get back together with he he propose to get back with you be a huge red flag to I that he s desperate to get you a stable factor back in his life whatever it take to do that   sweethea tre carefully promise be nice but your mental health come first before his and divorce   be expensive
if you follow your hea be you be scared and feel insecured go for what will give you peace of mind and the oppounity to heal your choice would affect your kid and family directly or indirectly you do not need stress wish you all the good get well
if you follow your hea be you be scared and feel insecured go for what will give you peace of mind and the oppounity to heal your choice would affect your kid and family directly or indirectly you do not need stress wish you all the good get well
honestly move on without he he may be on a high right now probably on his med but have it be long enough to be very sure he will remain on his med will he spiral out of control and hu you yet again all these doubt all these question can you honestly tell yourself to ignore your own conscious first and foremost your child be against any relationship with he because they suffer right along with you after he break your hea and then try to kill himself can you truly say his love have more woh than your peace of mind or the peace of mind of your child I personally would place the wellness of my child and myself before any man no matter how much I love he please think thing through before make any decision you may regret in the long run many blessing to you and your
since you have not invest a lifetime as I have and your child and you equally agree that this be relationship on a downward spiral I would back out without any fuher attachment sound like he have get help and it be his decision to continue it be your own decision to take care of you the good you can guilt free you have to or you yourself will end up not be able to function continue treatment and suppo be the key though
run do not walk the other way you have child he be not stable yet and the stress of a regular relationship be hard on someone stable yet alone someone so fresh out of a trauma plus you have already say you find a good guy follow your head he be just try to fill a void
I really wish that the guy I fall in love with that would rather be scared of the stigma around bipolar that he just leave I
when she get like that she be get so much in her head its hard for she to comunicatebelieve I its very distressin for herbut be strong she do love you x
let she ignore you and do not take it personally maintain your own hobby and such too   these struggle can consume people around we too you stay healthy and look after yourself too suppo by be stable and steady and just wait fir   when she be able to reengage
I feel the way he do always afraid of lose my man no matter how much he assure I I be not go to the good thing be to just let he know always that your here you love he and your not leave its frustrating because you know your not go to leave he but he be feel alone because he know no one and he be in a new place it will take time but stick with it he will come around in time however you have get to give he that time here if you need any advice
I be really sorry and wish I could do more to help       I be read through the comment amd see alot comment about bipolar I have very similar situation with suddenly get really depressed and sometimes it even go to serious anger and irritation in secondsdoe that mean I could be bipolar
possibly   bipolarism well know symptom be rapid mood swing with little to no warning or reason   it would be good to speak with a doctor if you suspect there could be an issue   I have a mild form that coexist with depression and anxiety   I do not experience the high mania but I do have depressive episode that come on suddenly with no trigger and they disappear in much the same way
I find it really hard to work with other human lol try to get back in to the work place but people attitude and boundary make my mh bad so I now volunteer from home for an animal rescue far less pressure and the freedom to have bad day without lose wage or feel bad when need time out
I work at home frequently but although I find the office environment really stressful and on occasion detrimental to my mh I would not want to work at home everyday as I know myself and I would not see anyone
I use nexium and sifrol sifrol be a godsend for the restlessness and apparently the magnesium in the nexium would be help too the nexium be originally prescribe for heaburn though good of luck hun x
in addition to the requip for restless leg at bedtime I take   capsule of ltryptophan I also take gaba to calm   relax I usually I take it with my ltryptophan before bed however anytime I can take the gaba instead of my xanax I do your body produce gaba but some people benefit from also take a gaba supplement it have no chance of addiction and its easy on your body I buy these   supplement from thorne research   you can find they online their magnesium be superior to any I have take hope this help
I take requip for my restless leg have be take it for   year magnesium have also be prove to work in some case
I get restless leg every now and then I drink tonic water to combat it apparently quinine help
I have restless leg take zolofti be on a different mednow

yes every medication I have try bar my anxiety med have cause restless leg try take some magnesium and request a blood test

on effexor for many year side effect restless leg nothing help except paxola
klonopin should ceainly ease any restlessness ceainly have some blood work do to check potassium level and magnesium level
try the magnesiun oil spray it be brilliant for pain and restless leg
magnesium help I heap with restless leg
I hate my depression and anxiety even now we have still get   tory and dup government
it may not be possible to completely stop anxiety but there be thing you can do to manage it before it escalate there be excercise you can use I think they be pa of cbt mindfulness where you work through a situation go through how you be perceive it and what the reality if sutuation be   it be something that you have to continually work at you might always be anxious but there be way to cope with it well
listen to you tube meditation video on anxiety and relax the mind   work great for I
I suffer from serious panic attack and be diagnose with panic disorder   I learn that my neck injury be actually the because   if your atlas bone top veebra in your neck be out of alignment it cause the interference of your bodys ability to properly function such as improper flow of cerebral fluid   it basically cause your brain to not be able to flush properly and be deprive of the proper flow of fluid   my neck have be hold correct alignment now for three month and I have not have a panic attack the entire time where I use to have they all the time   if you would like any more info you can pm I  
that be pa of anxiety and depression we always over analize and we let get to we because we hold it in til we finally blow also thing that seem small to other be a big deal to we because our cope skill have change and thing just will happen just take a deep breath and do one day at a time
I have a lot of help with take turmeric with black pepper   that be say I also have some help talk about my anxiety with someone   I have get so work up at my job that I be have physical problem now   mostly low gi tract I will not get graphic or explain anymore   luckily I have a wife who understand and be suppoive   I hope you be able to find someone
its terrible hey I have general anxiety I wake up   there be anxiety flow through my body anxious about go to the store to be anxious that someone   pee on the toilet seat I almost lose my mind
unfounately I be extremely violently sick when take theseevery time I take one I would feel faint and be sickthen every time I miss it I would be sick tooso could not winhorrible drugwoh a try though because everyone else say differently
I be on fluoxotine for   year and never feel nauseous   I do get restless leg syndrome at night and hot flush they help alot to sta with but eventually they stop work for I I go from   mg a day to mg before change doctor to one who agree to send I to hospital to see a phyciatrist before be allow to be wean off they and change to something more suitable x
I have have nausea as a side effect for many med but I have never acruelly throw up from they you may feel uncomfoable but actually vomit be pretty rare as far as I know your result may vary but after try   or so different med   I never have one make I throw up good luck and I wish youthe good
I know the long list of side effect be very scary I have be on med for   year fluoxetine be one of my med it really be excellentfor I my psychiatrist and I have work hard on get the right dosage and med thing be much well but as frustrating and scary it be to have to take medicationyour quality of life will truly be well
I use purata and it really help   I drink a   mg an hour before I go anywhere where I might have an anxiety attack and use a   mg at night
you be the first person I have everheard of besides myself with this fear you will not know how the med affect you till you try it do inse suggest take with food or on an empty stomach can you ask dr or pharmasist for suggestion do you have someone who can sit with you till you know it will not do you that way I wish I have more help instead of just question it suck I know but you can not know till you try it maybe some music or a walk for distraction in stead of sit around dread it I do not know but I feel ya
I think it be definitely woh a try   with medication unfounately it be a bit of trial and error until you find the right one for you and the correct dose as they can vary but I be tell today by a doctor for somebody else that that medication can help with anxiety so I guess your gp would have take your situation into account when prescribe they acute anxiety can sta at a very young age and can then lead to other thing if not address   hopefully you be make great stride in try to get help to overcome this awful condition   it can be terrible at time however take medication be not always easy for some people so completely understand the thing you ve say   really well do for seek help well wish x

it can be so hard sometimes when each paner have a mental health condition   as you be in the us I be in youk I be unsure what professional suppo you have access to   I have read lot of post from people in the we and usually no mention be make of any suppo they be receive so it might be that the only help available be therapy which you have to pay for suppoe someone else with a mental health problem can be exhaust in itself and if you be suffer too then it can be twice as hard   I be sure on one of your good day it be far easy and it can be very rewarding and therapeutic for you I often think that while I be help other I be not focusse on myself which be a good thing as mental illness can seem very self centre sometimes which can be pretty hard to deal with I be sure you be a wonderful suppo to your boyfriend and you appear to be really help he move forward and gain the strength necessary to socialise and make new friend   I be sure it be sometimes very tiring for you   hopefully with every good positive experience your boyfriend have this will help he learn to manage and hopefully eventually cope well with his anxiety which sometimes it can be cripple   I would like to think as he learn to move forward this would help you too sometimes when we be struggle ourselves we do not always have the energy to effectively suppo someone else too when we need all our strength for self preservation   to look after yourself you ideally need help   do you have family or friend you can lean on   there be no easy answer unfounately recovery from both be not easy it take a lot of strength and determination some day we have those some we do not   it can seem a huge mountain to climb sometimes but small step be the key small but significant goal be impoant you be do a wonderful job by the sound of thing but try to get help and take care x

my advice would be as a person with bp   that if ever you do not know what to do to help she simply ask if all else fail tell she she be never alone because you will be there however due to experience with date and move fast maybe slow down sometimes in the past when people say it fast I would believe they and because of mania I would have grandiose unrealistic expectation from they and get wicked upset if they do not live up to they it have cause a ton of fight with past paner I have grow a lot since then but since you be new to it keep educate yourself you get major point for that but overall do not give up and if you ever have to explain why have a set reason or issue you would have to leave over ex cheating be a deal breaker for many people etc make sure she know and understand that I love that you be ask for advice here it show you care deeply I wish you luck and thank for prove not all people suck and be afraid to love someone with a mental illness as it be literally that way for many people with mental health issue we deserve love too and ahole make we forget that sorry for ramble I hope this be helpful

I will give you this advice from someone suffer from bipolar anxiety bpd and ptsd there will be time she will not want to get out of bed do not force she just lie there beside she and cuddle there will be time she do not want to leave the house do not make she   she will not want to go anywhere by herself do not make she you will become her sage place she will become extremely insecure about the dumb thingsbuy her flower cook her dinner do not put she down when all she want to do be sleep when you ate deal wear these disease it take a lot of motivation to get up and hey tatu because we dread go into public because we think everyone be take about we and see what be wrong with we remind she all the time that tipu love hey because when she be depressed she will forget and get desperate and think she be a burden to you and think that be a burden on you
it will be a struggle every day make sure you give her space when she need it but not too much show she you care even when it seem like she hate your gut because she do not it be just her brain make her act that way let she be open with how she be feel without judgement my ex be able to tell my mood be change before I do and he would get I to talk about what be go on in my brain and sometimes it would stop or at least make the swing less intense let she know that on bad night she can wake you up because she need a hug and to be hold and tell how strong she be for wake up everyday to do everything over again if she be too depressed to get out of bed to clean or eat bring her food in bed and clean for her little thing can mean a lot more than you think when you be swinge back and foh

do you know if he be have a manic episode depressive or mixed I live with bipolar disorder and I have different method for different episode the hard pa about a depressive episode for I be that there be literally just no stimulation in my brain someone could run in my room with firework and I probably would not react much to it but because I accept that my brain chemistry be not react properly and I know this I have learn to force myself to get restimulate it be not easy at all and it be a process that can take day or week with many speed bump but   I get a decent amount of sunlight every day   I do something active every day even if it be only a   minute walk but I try to at least go for a   minute run to get the juice flow also kill   bird with one stone if you run outside   I make a sho to do list every day nothing crazy maybe   thing and a lot of day I only do one or none and it be frustrating and I want to give up and go back to bed and quit but the next day I get up and try it again and I tell myself it be ok and try to maintain positive thought because the anxious and bad thought I know be not organic they be not my thought they be call intrusive thought for a reason they come and they go but I do not let they decide who I be as a person eventually after a while of push myself I sta realize that I want to run when I wake up and I want to get that school assignment do and I want to take care of myself and continue build the foundation of my future as a paner of someone live with bp I would suggest be that gentle suppo suggest go on a walk or run with they or ask they if they at least want to sit outside for a bit maybe invest in something like a hammock they still do not have to move or leave home but they at least be outside which be one small step close the to do list be big for I my anxiety build up exponentially when I let thing like school or work pile up and it make I shut down even hard but when I sta get thing do no matter how small or simple it really help my confidence come back cross thing off a to do list have be know to be a good way to release dopamine and help stimulate the brain I hope this help feel free to message I if you have any question
honestly I think your approach would depend on what thing he isis not do be it lack of self care lack of motivation to go to work decide to stop take med without speak to his dr or self destructive behavior such as binge drink gambling before pay bill drug use or self harm be it a pattern he fall into during his depressive cycle or be this a new development I be sorry to ask such personal question but my advice would differ base on what be go on and how seriously it could impact his life andor health both immediately and long term sorry if that be no help but if you want to message I privately you be welcome to sometimes we need suppo and understanding and sometimes we need someone who care enough to push we out of our comfo zone of misery and help we get the medical help we need I have multiple diagnosis include bpd my husband have be amazing through it all once he learn what be actually go on with mehe be great before but understanding go a long way to open up communication so I could tell he what I need and not feel judgedguiltyashamed

one more thing an impoant aspect of the aicle you condescendingly share with I be that the author make the choice how to identify in fact quote the author of the aicle you share ultimately the key be to ask whenever possible how a person choose to identify rather than make assumption or impose your own belief but thank again maria for the pickmeup comment a little piece of advice for you   you have no idea what my issue be and may want to rethink the way you interact with other online paicularly in a bipolardepressionanxiety open page

I guess the question I be ask be whether you ve have the oppounity to actually explain how you feel in full to your husband and then to your child in a way they can understand that be probably the most simplistic and good case scenario to increase understanding for all   if your family know more could they be more understanding but of course I completely understand it be not always as simple as that   there may be many reason why you can not or be unable to explain why you act or feel as you do you may not completely understand yourself   with mental illness it can take a long time until you really get to grip with the symptom thought and feeling for you to understand it let alone anyone else it can also be that sufferer feel ashamed a failure or weak in some way that they can not cope or   spend all day in bed or can not get well   these be very natural feeling but it be not a sign of weakness it be a sign of strength when you can admit something be wrong mental illness be not something to be ashamed of our brain be the most complex organ so like other pas of our body sometimes they do not work correctly and definitely not a failure we be all different and we should not beat ourselves up or be unkind to ourselves   some people do not really want to deal with it mental illness be not easy for love one to deal with    do you have any other suppo with recovery this involve many thing I wonder if there be other thing which might help you   be a mother be very hard very demand we might look at other and think they be do so well and we compare ourselves and can not understand why we act like we do but with a mental health problem it be hard enough cope with our own issue be there anyone who could help with the child   lot of question but just look at possible option take good care x
I think your hea be in the right place but just sit someone down and try to explain such a major feeling be not just that easy I staed to post how to cope with a love one with depressionbipolar along with anxiety my husband learn a lot from site it may sound stupid but it be much easy for family to understand from other avenue
if my boyfriend would let I this would be my permanent setup   unfounately this be just through summer I love the sound of a fan and the cool air on my face especially help in a panic attack   it give the impression you have extra air to breathe
I usually put on a white noise track on my laptop or music specifically design to help you sleep have the exact same effect though I once have a dormmate who would leave her tv on all night so I have to pull my cover up over my head to make it dark enough to sleep so I would blow a little fan under my blanket to avoid feel suffocate
same here when I get out of routine and become ungrounded I struggle

wow yep same here with try different med and cope mechanism I be sorry to hear that you struggle also hug
I have talk to my dr about ect and I have as I say research it   and roughly   of the informationcase I be find where people who have have it have actually repoe how they be do monthsyear afterwards have show substantial long term effect from this treatment they repo a euphoria type effect after treatment that can last maybe   month after which their depression go back to how it be or it be bad   they suffer deficit they never repoe have before there be also evidence that hospitalsdr who administer this treatment do not keep record of follow up with the patient who have complete their ect session long than day approximate the risk factor for this treatment at least to I far far far outweigh any possible benefit

I have research ect and have find that in a lot of case this form of treatment can cause extreme damage both sho term and long term to the brain while this do not happen in every case the risk be still to high for I to consider as my mind be really all I have
if you have do itthen I guess theyre not much else to dobecause that be all I have ever be about I do not ever want to get to this pointi would rather be twelve foot underleap of faith be in my bloodi have find that people will and can try to make you a product of your own fear if you stare at the line the trick be to have nothing to lose hahahok wellfear nothing

it may be easier say than do but practice a thought process like this more frequently help you train yourself to be less stress in future situation
I could not have say it well I be constantly   tell myself that what I be stay upset over be petty but it be the letty thing that stick and be hard to let go of
do not be too hard on yourself hun your body be go through a huge transition and your hormone be all over the place too sometimes we put thing down to our bipolar when actually we be goingfeele totally normal emotion feeling and tiredness relate to something else I definitely would keep in touch with your gp though even if it be only to talk about how you be feel what you be think and to relay any of your worry or concern to they sometimes just talk thing through with someone can make you feel well and your gp can also give you lot of advice and reassurance   I personally would not change my medication at such a time you be nearly there now   I be the same over my medication now due to previous change make I do not react well to the one they want I to try and I have to stand my ground   about revee back to my original med of seraline and quetiapine if it be not break do not fix it I say   maybe it be just that you be just go through the normal pregnancy motion   and always remember you be strong brave and courageous not only because you battle on every day with your own issue but also because you be fight through pregnancy and for your baby   you be a trooper never forget that I wish you all the luck in the world and good wish in the future tx
go to the doctor pregnancy change your hormone so much and they will go up and down really bad especially after bih you can choose not to change your med but your doctor need to be aware of this and a change of med can be a temp thing til your hormone settle some from the pregnancy also post paum depression be a very real threat especially to those of we with a history of mental illness please do not try to just tough it out go get help you want to be your good for your child then you need to take care of yourself first it be like the same concept when your on a plane you put your oxygen mask on first then your child you can not care for a tiny human if you do not care for yourself trust I I be   week post paum diagnose post paum depression there be a lot of time take care of my baby be really hard like really hard but it be easy to handle by take care of myself
yes go to the doc your body undergo so many change during pregnancy that what use to work may not anymore I be finally put on anxiety med in my th month of pregnancy because my anxiety be spike my blood pressure so high I would go to your obgyn and see if heshe have any advice on what to try that will not affect your baby I get my prescription from mine because I trust he to know the affect well than my gp would
I be on prozac when I get pregnant and come off although consider safe being on it in the rd trimester can cause the baby to suffer from withdrawal I be struggle but hang on also in my rd trimester now it be a riskbenefit weigh game and it be hard personally I will be do limited breastfeeding after bih so I can get on a full spectrum of med and treat it aggressively good of luck to you hun we momma put up with a lot
oh wow I be on mgs of seroquel when I fall pregnant drop it cold turkey because I be so worried about what it would do to bub I have get a healthy almost   month old now and the depression and get back stable have be hard but I be come good
be not you worried about the effect of the medication on you be unborn child yike hope you be child be bear healthy and happy
the doctor would take into consideration the side effect verses the good of both mother and babythat be what she be sayingthat she be worried about the baby and herselfencouragement not judgment
of course this lady would worry about her baby what a silly question she be ask for help not for you to judge she I be bipolar I have   child my first I be not on medication I have very bad postnatal depression because of not have medication while pregnant this affect my child more then tablet would have I just could not bond with she thankfully by the time doctor have figure out what be wrong and staed I on medication the bond that I and my first child be now amazing and my second child I take medication through my whole pregnancy for she she be healthy at bih weigh a nice weight and the good thing I feel normal and I bond with my child straight away if I ever have a   I would not stop my medication unless I be tell to by doctor for any reason
very truei fight my depression everydaysomeday I win and some day it winsmy doc have cut down my anxiety and depression med really
I rapid cycle which for I mean that I be manic way more often than not during these phase with my hypersexuality its like walk around as an expose nerve the wind blow and you want it the risky the well the rougher the well it have destroy relationship
yes I have lose people really impoant to I due to hypersexuality they can not understand how that person be not who I be how I can not control it or how ashamed I get of my action
yes the shame be the bad I have lose my wife and child because of it I live alone in fear of be with anyone now
it be suck relationship have fail because they sta to think it be only about sex and it be not and then I have my down cycle where I do not even want to be touch and they take it personally I feel so ashamed try to talk about because our culture teach we that sex be taboo
I have lose friend since my teen because of this issue it be a relief to discuss really whether in be promiscuous or continually want to self relieve very embarrassing when catch or think you may have be a constant battle
I have major depressive disorder but have this issue the dr tell I that my mind be just more like a man than a woman when it come to sex   I be really upset because that answer do not help I at all
every doc I have be to have ask about that I know at times my drive be over the top but I would have never connect it to my illness I actually have to have a doc sit down and explain it to I before I accept it now when I be even paially manic I refuse to have sex even if I be in a committed relationship I find myself to get irritated when they do not scratch the itch that tend to never go away so to prevent an argument I just keep my leg close until I know I be level again the depressed episode have an affect on my sex drive as well if I fall too low just for someone to touch I piss my soul off to the point where I will go sleep on the couch because just wrap his arm around I tend to irritate I
this be something that have cause I a lot of pain and struggle and if I ever mention it to therapist or psychiatrist they either write it off or blame I for lack of self control this be why it be impoant to have a good therapist
I be sorry you feel shame your feeling be perfectly normal for someone in your situation
my god I be very sorry amber peacock I have a fear of getting involve in relationship which suck because sometimes it can be lonely
but seriously at least here in the state we be so repressed about sex I can see how this would be a problem no one want to talk about sex I mean unless they be brag or something it be weird how we handle sex in the state it be not handle in a healthy way by anyone even the mentally healthy
happen in a manic state and be pa of the instant gratification mood for some this can be harmful and they may become abusive in behavior but do not worry most be just over active at time that be my take
you just do but before that before I turn   I struggle a lot after I turn   I learn how to control it a little more easy do not get I wrong I still deal with it just not as bad prior
no problem also it be even possible to feel intensely turn on physically even when you be not even close to be turn on mentally or emotionally especially in situation that remind you of past traumatic event this be actually one thing that I be super ashamed of before finally talk to my dr it be basically your brain way of cope with an anxiety induce situation andor flashback it be a physical manifestation of an anxiety attack no different than hyperventilate for year I feel ashamed and disgusted for have this reaction to ceain movie scene I think I be a disgusting person for be able to feel sick to my stomach ashamed and arouse at the same time talk to my dr and find out that w my condition and history as a victim of violence that it be not uncommon to have these contradict feeling be honestly life change be aware that I be not some perve and why it be happen and be able to sta acknowledge and process through those feeling and issue be a huge step in the right direction for my mental and emotional health I wish I would have have such a suppoive and understanding dr in my teenage year when I really struggle with thing a suppoive dr and suppoive paner be two invaluable thing to have when you be deal w mental health concern have a paner who can go w the flow and not question when I need it right that minute or when I just want to cuddle for two month be great it take the pressure off for feel like you should do it because you be suppose to want to do it and none of those guilt trip for sex when you be in a depressive state sorry I guess I have go much faher into detail than you ask for I guess I just want you to know that you be not alone you be not wrong or break for have these feeling and it be completely possible to have a happy healthy sex life and relationshipmarriage with these issue once you learn your trigger and mood and communicate w your paner and find a happy middle ground together
unfounately it be a real issue I do not know if it be cause by a hormone fluctuation due to chemical change when we hit a manic phase or what exactly but it be like you crave sex like you be in heat and get a euphoric physical and emotional high off of it then in depressive phase we usually do not crave sex as much and want a more emotionally nuuring relationship it can lead to issue such as risky sexual behavior put yourself in potentially dangerous situation you normally would not such as one night stand or not use a condom and even put you in a position to seek emotional sexual validation from someone besides your paner or even actually physically cheat on your paner even if you be not the cheat type sometimes emotional sexual validation be   enough such as your paner tell you how beautifulsexy you be and be fliy other time if you be feel more emotionally distant you may feel the need to get down and diy multiple time before you can feel satisfied for the time be it be also not uncommon to desire more primal rough meaningless sex during these phase and feel leave want if you be normally they type who enjoy more gentle love make without communication it can lead to frustration in the bedroom with good communication you paner can learn to read you sign of manic state and be able to adjust their approach to sex accordingly but first they have to be able to understand why you be feel this way and what they can do to help what to avoid and so on   sorry I may have have one too many conversation w my psychiatrist concern sex as some of my issue disturb I until I find out they be pretty normal for people w my diagnosis learn that there be not anything wrong w I it be just how my brain work definitely make it easy to talk to my husband about without feel ashamed feel free to pm I if you would like to ask any question in private
actually google be not all that reliable however I have to know if this statement we true and if hypersexuality be real as I have question about my own sexuality reagrde my diagnosis with depressionanxiety
it can lead to risky behavior especially in severe case think black snake moan type behavior    in a committed relationship it can be fun to enjoy though
absolutely I go through those same thought every day I have be diagnose with bipolar disorder anxiety with panic attack ptsd add and severe depression have you consider seek out a therapist or a psychiatrist to read diagnosis and see if medication may help
i d like to but I never really know where to begin I staed have stress tic and go to a neurologist and they prescribe I topamax to help with my anxiety and I tell they it do not do anything and they never really listen to I and I just quit go and take the med after awhile because it seem they do not want to help no matter what I tell they I think I be go to go to my regular doctor and find out what she can do to help I
omg I miss I more than anything else that I have lose through all of my struggle
it be such a horrible illness to have I be right there with you carman
friend I have be through the whole gamut of depression and angziety med and cymbalta be one of those that work well for the one it work for and dosent work well in the long run for some I would suggest that you have a good talk with the doc and please let he know how you be feel for your well be friend   I have be where you be very depressed and feel like all would be well with out I my fiancee be my good friend she see my mood and total lack of desire to do anything I be in facked give up on everything and everyone so I really do know how you feel friend and I will share this with you I go all the way to the act of take my life thank god someone see I and call for help   I tell you all of this so you know that I feel your pain and know your true feeling so please talk to the dr and I be sure many people have tell you that I will be hear if you need to talk but I really mean that I will be hear I know how the thought and feeling can be overwhelming take care and stay in touch if I can help you be a good person and you be woh it
I state take cymbalta last month and they stae I at   mg I get really bad shake in my hand for a bout   day then staed sweating profusely I want to change it but people tell I to give it a shot I hate the sweating pa and it help I sleep and my appetite be not like it be either
you be definitely bipolar try lithium it be the one med for bipolar that will not because tardive dyskinesia maybe klonopin at least your reach out   you absolutely need a therapist   especially if you feel you want to hu other lexapro target major anxiety which seem to be most of what make up bipolar it help my   family member they still struggle but they be not as anger one of my family member say it help they from feel like they want to killmedical marijuana need to be not just for chronic pain but definitely pass for bipolar because of the dystonia type side affect the anti psychotic medicine for bipolar can cause   I be pray you get control because it be just as hard on the family and you will want your child to grow up healthy normal life can be hard enoughblessingspraying
I see my family member grow up with this disorder it a major stuggle and be hard to communicate with they my dad have bipolar and be an alcoholic   he be pass on but think back I feel so bad that he grow up in a day and age where these problem be not protrudingly aware as they be today I have experience horrid past event and I can tell you those problem you can get over with the right talk therapy I also hear exercise can help I know you posse bout of excessive energy with bp so if you can take up walk jig run to burn some of it off I think one of the main thing be to try an catch yourself when you go into mania I be not sure if you have control over thattry to just keep tell yourself it be the illness then maybe lift weight or jog you definable need to control the depression pa how be your job status work hard with good pay do much for the selfesteem hang in there
you be not alone therapy along with the right medication can help tremendously if your psychiatrist be not there for you find a new one who will be I can not imagine what stress you have go through in your life but know that god do not give we more than we can handle you be a strong man and you will find the help you need when think of harm yourself remember that your kid need you when I would have harmful thought I would remember my family I can do this you will be in my thought
I want to but I be afraid they would turn I away    claim I be not in a volatile state to do so
if you feel there be more to it beg they for help do not leave their office until they help you you can not be expect to live like this your wife need to get involve more in understand your illness I know you feel like she be give up on you but probably just do not understand maybe get some book from the library or if you do not want to go there yourself maybe buy some online maybe if she read the effect and symptom of these illness might help she help you may not realise this but know you have an illness and feel like there be not something quite right go on with you be a massive step in the right direction just keep hold on it must be so scary to feel this way and not know how you will be from one hour to the next I have witness similar thing as you when I be grow up and be beat by my step dad and sexually abuse that all fuck you up I understand where you be at I be sorry for all that have happen to you and I wish you all the good mate
hi I suffer the same your background sound a bit like mine I be you not long ago my family walk on egg shell I never mean to be the way I be I just could not handle or cope until I be put on lithium it help a lot my family staed to feel more comfoable around I so maybe you need to look at your medsa for they understand my husband do not need to understand just a hug when I be feel low or I just take time out and let everyone know I be not feel to good tell your kid and wife the truth about how your feeling that way they know it be not they it be your illness I tell my kid and they understand they have live through it with I not tell your wife and kid that when you feel the way you do and if your nasty or irrational it be not there fault you can not go through this on your own your a family and let they in they get to know the real you and your wife and kid will be able to go through life   feeling understand you also need to say sorry when you be be nasty or say something you should not it take time but as family we work it out I be sure you can too I be also   and think it get a little bit hard I hope this have help if you need to ask I anything you can pm I I know what it be like x
how sad I be read your postit be like listen to my son who have exactly the same symptom as you be experience it take many year for he to finally find a professor of psychiatry who put he on the right med and he be now cope much well do not give up on yourself there be always a solution I just suffer from severe depression and anxiety but understand what you be go through send you hug and blessing from south africa
oh your not alone at all   I be sorry your suffering but you pretty much take this out of my brain   and there be a a few thing you mention I will also look into   thank you for sharing   help I feel not so alone    yeah find a new therapist doctor whatever   I do suggest try marijuana and find the right strain for you and there be also dif product that do not get you stone if you need to work    I really hope you find something and some one to help   iknow how scary and fucking frustrating it be   take care if you can not take it one day at a time try to takw it hour by hour xo
all else be equal with your mental health issue something happen to a large majority of people when they approach or hit    it be almost like a midlife awakening of sos where you sta to really dive in and process some of the shit that have lead you up to this point   I be bipolar ll also   borderline personality disorder have come up more than once with my current psych also   it be what it be   flow with it and continue on with the process   try not to ovehink it and do not stop until you find something that work for you   I take lithium which I be tell be the gold standard first line treatment for bp and it work very well for I   take a deep breath and talk to your wife when you be not in the midst of a crisis and ask she to take the lead for you and do not beat she figuratively up if you can at all avoid it   we all need someone in our corner   stay the course for you and the kid   you be not alone
ptsd suck they say I have it during my intake assessment but the psychiatrist dismiss it not sure why she ask I some trigger question and I guess I do not give an appropriate response although I have be plague by be terrorize as a child I will definitely be get a new psychiatrist thank you nick
unfounately a lot of people live with that stigma     but what they do not understand be that its hard to get the help need and deal with everyday life too I have hear that only weak people go to crazy farm but personally I think that only the strong people be willing to try anything to get the help they need and deserve financial issue will always be a problem and to that I say the risk be woh the reward and there be always bankruptcy finance should not hold people back from feel well good luck to you   
sound like a very complex set of symptom the thing that truly help I be dbt therapy and mindfulness it be very difficult for I to begin practice consistently but I keep at it its take I   year of learn that essential oil calm my anxiety a mood stabilizer and sleep med make sure I be get enough sleep stay hydrated do my dbt worksheet and have become more patient with myself it be not easy to change my reaction and volatile aggression but it can be do it be a lifestyle change like any other dbt work if you work it also would recommend bpd central forum and also nami family to family program for your adult family member wish you all the good
well get in the practice of a mindful life very difficult I be go to esp for people who struggle w mental illness we tend to feel out of control and over reactive so practice stay in the present be quite challenging become a master self control be daunt least it be for I
I see you and I hear you and I acknowledge you I have be on epilim and serdep for   year to treat my bipolar which be as severe if not more so than you I want to encourage you today you be not alone my friend I have do many thing I regret have be in jail   time as a result use drug and be in countless fight I be a former marine so violence and death do not scare I drug be not the answer however I suppo the use of cannabis oil   I have learn how to manage my bipolar and would be only too happy to help you if you would like my opinion and I say opinion for a reason because I can not take advice and instruction that well and feel the same may apply to you message I if you like and I will help remember one thing you be not your mindyour mind have bipolar your soul do notlearn to live in your soul and your life will changein my opinion from one bipolar to another from the other side of the worldi care for you

yvonne white I take it for depression and anxiety it have really help my mood disorder I take   mg every morning just once a day
I want to agree with everyone that her self harm be not your fault not now and not ever having say that maybe the two of you can talk about the stressful thing that make she feel the need to cut be there thing you can work on together even if they be small it can make a world of difference know that you be work together as a team to conquer a common enemy for example I have chronic pain and depression and my husband and we make sure that we both say we be mad at the pain and the depression not mad at I my pain and depression be pa of I but they be not my whole self banding together have make we strong because fight these demon alone be exhaust I would also strongly encourage you to find a couple counselor even if you can only afford a few session if you be a religious person you could also see if your place of worship offer reducedfree counseling try check out namiorg and find suppo group in your area   you should not have to fight alone I hope you can find the strength you need to find your own healing and to suppo your paner in theirs
you can not I stress can not be hold responsible for the action of somebody else her self harm be her choice you do not make she do it you need to be strong for you not her
I know how hard it be to talk to people with social anxiety cloud all your thought but talk to each other and probably with a professional as well if possible it really be the good and only answer try to figure our how to help each other I would give almost anything to have another person in my life who be similar do not let yourself get fuher away
I have ptsd chronic depression anxiety and bipolar your symptom qualifie you for social security disability I be on it take I a year to get you need a disability lawyer otherwise you will never get it
what do your comment mean I be so confused lol dani
effexor be terrible with withdraw and actually make I want to kill myself if its work for you just give it time I be always tired and I be on zoloft its well than have panic attack
I take effexor for year it help I a great deal though I be always super tired and I gain quite a bit of weight on it I be afraid to go off it after hear about side effect but I really do not have any trouble at all my dr wean I properly if this med work for you stick with it for a while
totally heather hrejsa it be awful I think my body finally decide I just do not need it and it be really mess with I I definitely have bad day but I can manage and deal which be great I be back to the old I although I need adivan to help my anxiety other then that I be pill free I can feel thing and not feel like I be trap in my movie mind lol if that make sense
effexor make I more depressed as well it be horrible
I too I be scared to get off it if I ever do
I do miss a a dose once and it be horrible I could handle it to an extent my doctor try to help I but sometimes I think she be tired of try especially since I be still suffer a lot from thing like lack of good quality sleep extreme fatigue even though my mood be more stable she say once my mood be more stable the rest would get well and it be not
seroquel give I horrible reaction along with a   weight gain puffiness and an attempt at suicide I opt out
do it upset your stomach
I be on mg daily I think it help to scared to stop and try otherwise as my bone literally sta hue and I get electric shock if it be miss
if it be not break do not fix it   change psych med can be life alter and in some case life threaten   when disclose your medication regiman to other you will receive all kind of advice even from professional   do your own research on fda warning for your med   avoid word on the street advice   most impoantly listen to your own body and mind
I have never be on celexa but effexor do wonder for I only thing be how horrible I feel when I skip a dose I be afraid come off it will be hard
oh no that scare the fuck out of I I be so sorry you have to go thru that paxil give I the brain zap really bad
it be a horrible drug to come off even when wean   I try for a few month before christmas last and even wean properly my head be still get brain zap   month later   back on it now cu the world get too real without it   good depression drug to numb feeling and help you handle the world but a fucking nightmare to try and come off
jenn if I may ask do cymbalta put on weight or be it still too soon to tell I be ready to give med another shot out of desperation I have a bit of a problem deal with weight gain some say I have an eat disorder once I sta pack the weight on I automatically quit the med sound petty but it be just I
I have severe adhd ptsd depression and anxiety plus a dissociative disorder so find a drug that work be hard I just take hydroxizine now I be pregnant so after baby come I will try thing again effexor never again trip I out
send he out to work that will take some of the stress if that do not work give he a few strong whiskey that would do the trick      
the first step be to make sure he be not use drug or alcohol because that be not helpful at all when you have depression and try to commit suicide a lot of people do that because they use narcotic or drink alcohol the thing be sometimes people do not say whether they come from it will be easy I think like for I to let you know where you can get help because I do not even know where be people location cuz I be in new york city right now do not give up I can not stop write you about my life because what will never finish trust I I take care of my daughter we bipolar disorder my son we bipolar autism as bergen adhd and more and more diagnosis and myself we bipolar ptsd anxiety depression fibromyalgia what else do you want you want I to continue tell you my diagnosis trust I sweetie I be not go to give up and no diagnosis I get day I do not want to leave but I realize the only person can take my life as god you strong woman you do the right thing and I know in this page will be the right person to conduct yourself why you guy get to do as a family but never feel guilty what you write make I feel even cry because I know you have to be a wonderful woman that be what he pick you and look he be bad day you be there for he just continue prayer to god god bless you and I hope everything go well for you and your family
this may sound a little off beat and I may not be right but I know from personal experience of having do suicide attempt I never tell anybody about it I just do it unsuccessfully I might add because I be still here at least he be tell you when he feel that way which be normally a cry for help maybe they need to try different medication it be hard to be a guinea pig and find the right one be he interested in counseling or group therapy do you   have enough influence on he to get he to try these thing maybe even suggest to he that he be not able to stay strong for himself at least try to stay strong for his child because if he actually do try to commit suicide and die just not he that he be hue it be the whole family and I bet you that your child would never be able get over an event like that sometimes even child feel guilty and think that it be their fault because of what their parent have do your child need to be spare from those feeling try and see if you can get he reengage with some talk therapy and be positive that they can find a medication that work for he
please be very careful suicidality and homicidality often coexist simultaneously in someone who be move in and out of psychosis   the threat of suicide can also be a manipulative technique to prevent you from flee for safety with your child   that do not mean his threat of suicide be an empty threat   but no one can begin heal with the fear of death linger over head   if your gut tell you to leave then leave   I be not speak in judgment but from extensive experience not just with myself but in almost every relationship in my family   please follow your motherly instinct over your desire to be his wife
I know it be a completely different situation but this response be more geared towards you my late husband fight cancer for   year before he lose we have   boy already     and have just find out a week after he have his diagnosis that I be pregnant with our rainbow baby about   month before he pass he tell I he be ready to go and that be truly the hard thing I have ever hear that do not even describe it I actually get really upset with he because I could not understand why he would just give up fighting for we like that I finally understand what he be try to tell I but I promise you those word still haunt I today if I have any advice for someone that be hear this same thing from someone they love it be for you yourself go talk to a dr or in my case dr and social worker therapist as soon as possible also try to lean on your personal suppo system more than I do and just remember to breathe as for he I absolutely agree with what be say above about get he to a hospital so they can get he feel well there be absolutely no shame in have to do that mental illness be just as real as thing like hea disease and diabete I hope some pa of this help my hea   and prayer sincerely go out to you and your family if you ever feel like talk please please friend and then message I so I will see it right away

you need to see a new doctor I have bipolar and struggle really bad but be cope with appropriate med and extra suppo definitely seek medical help urgently because sometimes thought and what other think be just threat can turn into suicide without any hesitation as horrible as it sound some people find that it be their only chance of be free from it all I have lose   friend from suicide and none of they even show symptom of depression it be a very well hide illness that can be treat to be manageable xxxx

in all honesty you truly need to check in to a hospital take care of yourself and do not worry about your family yell at you you can tell someone at the hospital how you be treat by your family it may be consider abuse for the way they treat you also you might want to look into disability for your illness

I know you do not want to but go to the hospital may be your good bet you be more impoant than your family view do not worry about they yell at you you can ask the hospital to not allow they to visit you you do what you need to even if it be against the wish of the family you be love and you will get through this

I agree with lynn all we have be our health that be a basic human need and without good health we have nothing other thing in life may need to be put on hold like your schooling you can not be the good student unless you feel mentally stable   I have be where you be at I lose my job because of my mental illness I have legal trouble I reach rock bottom when my husband ask for a divorce and tell I I be too unstable to see my child at the time I balk at he assume I be inadequate as a parent I realize now that my judgement be clouded because of my illness it take I a year to gain an inkling of trust back with he here I be   year later and the happy I have be in   year   this road be hard you need the suppo of family friend and medical professional I hope and pray you find that redhea

perhaps celexa and a hormone replacement would help   just a suggestion but it have help too often woman have major hormone issue that contribute to depression anxiety and insomnia just a suggestion
I be sorry to here that I take it for anxiety and depression and hot flash I take   mg a day
there be nothing wrong with effexor my daughter take it and it have totally change her life for the well she use to have such social anxiety the one thing about antidepressant and mood stabilizer be that they do not work on everyone the same way I have be on many different one over the year I have take viibryd for the last   year and my doctor just add cymbalta I do not think that be the correct spelling
the mood be fairly stable compare to usual it be the overwhelming amount of fatigue that I be deal with my memory be not great anymore and of course the pain
my doctor have give I time that have not work and the effexor be prescribe by a different doctor since I be so desperate I have select year upon year try to get well and find a good doctor be just as bad

it be without a doubt one of the well one I have have be on it since   and find it very effective
work well for I only side effect I have have be that it make I drowsy otherwise it be kick my anxiety and depression in the ball
I have terrible experience with it it cause extreme anxiety and brain zap I could not tolerate it and withdrawal be hell too but everyone react differently
very effective with anxiety
horrible side effect and almost impossible to come off find an alternative if possible
this be the only medication I have be able to take I have only be on it   week and already notice massive improvement with my anxiety and I have not cry once no nasty side effect neither I can eat and I be now able to sleep at night without sleep pill it be help I so much
no I have never try it but I would love to know if it work for you I be suffer with no medication and desperately look for a suppo group here in tampa so if anyone know of a doctor or specialist I can see on a slide scale maybe I do not have insurance so any advice would be helpfultyty d
I be in the trial study year back I notice a change could not really pin point what that change be but think it be well than nothing after continue for another   or   year I have to come off of it that be truly the most horrible experience of my life it be bad than come off of opiate   after a few week I have to check myself in the hospital for suicidal thoughtsintense thought my mood be vicious angry and unpredictable   be very careful take this drug and even more so when you have to come off of it there be side effect that they have not put on the label and withdraw be one of they

I be feel hopeless too for quite some time and could not get my severe panic and agoraphobia under control finally find a med combo that work I still have a journey ahead of I but I be do much well you will find that too you just have to keep try different med and therapy do not know you or your situation but I believe there be hope for we all
I love cymbalta be on it a while now but suppose to be take off all my psych med in the next come month as my paner and I be go to be try to become pregnant and worried about the withdrawal
it destroy my appetite for the first month or so otherwise I have have no side effect and it seem to be help I be back to enjoy little thing in life and my hobby I do not know about it be effect on anxiety because I take other stuff for that also I have less back pain which the doctor say could be from this medicine the downside I guess be that if I forget a dose then I sta to feel very uncomfoable about   hour after the miss dose it feel like electric current be discharge in my head and face but I have have this happen with several antidepressant I have be on antidepressant since I have an eating disorder in high school over ten year ago and this medicine seem to be the good yet or at least a close second pristiq be good too but sooooooo expensive if your insurance be not great then check the good rx website they have like coupon and stuff for all sos of med
ya I be thrilled then I go thru a personal rough patch where I be hungry again now I be awake after midnight be up since   be have not eat anything all day and if I be not worried about get ill I could probably go to sleep without eat all day but that be not healthy make sure to have balance snack even if you be not hungry because your body need it to stay strong

my mom have be on antidepressant and anxiety medication for nearly yr now for so long it seem nothing would work she be now on cymbalta   and rexulti and be a completely different person in a good way   everybody be different and will react differently to   ceain medication take it as prescribe and if you notice any side effect call your doctor immediately they be not go to give you something if they do not think it will work for you and your diagnosis good of luck to you
gail deshong   it feel like a weird panic attack all the time nothing visible but inside it feel horrible it get to the point that I could not function because it be so distract and bring I to psychosis
as already state it can be hard to come off of it it be probably good you be increase dosage gradually as already mention the withdrawal can be awful also please carefully read all of the side effect if you have some of the scary side effect happen please have a suppoive friend or family member on speed dial you might also consider healthy snack like chocolate cover nut if you be not allergic these may help a little with mood but be not a substitute for medication dosage modification should be do by the doctor with all of your experience with the medication disclose

I give up many time too but even so I never truly stop care I have social phobia and general anxiety disorder among a few other problem but they be not nearly as bad as the social phobia I can not get help from the right people because I can not express myself the way I want to like I can not tell somone what the problem be I can not even get to the point of talk to someonebut I have an idea that change my outlook even though it be still eat away at I it will get well I decide that I be go to sta record myself most of the time and sta a youtube channel it will give I a way to push through the anxiety on my own term and at my own pace it do give I hope and even if it fail it will still have help a lot but one of the big issue be that I keep get stuck on stae anything I always feel the need to be push in a direction so I can know what I be suppose to be do I hold myself back by not just go for it so this be I go for it lol I appologize to all the people that keep have to read my long postsand that be not a joke I really do not know if it be my anxiety or not but I feel like I be the only one who talk this much on facebook maybe even the whole internet lol okay maybe it be paially a joke I will shut up now

talk therapy dbt life balance class all of these be great the more you understand your disorder the well also remember you be not alone here this group also have be a great help to I talk with people with the same disorder and know how they manage it   do not expect medication if prescribe to work right away sometimes it do not work and another would have to be try everybody be different so medication would be trial and error until a combo work perfectly for you   I myself be currently on celexa but it only help I with the anxiety not the depression I be suppose to be take a mood stabilizer but I can not afford it right now without a job   again remember you be not alone in this
medication and dialectical behaviour therapy have work wonder for I do not delay and try not to be afraid thing can and will get well if you work at it
you have be give some very good advice by other already I will just say it be very normal to feel anxious on your return to your home with time it will pass as you slowly get back into the positive aspect of your day to day life style do not put too much pressure on yourself your only home take your time try to get some fresh air each day it be very easy to fall into a pattern of withdraw from life due to the anxiety personally I wish you well just do not put pressure on yourself immediately baby step work okay regard
have feel the samescared of my own shadowi there anyone who could stay with you until you have find your foot again
perfectly normal   when I would spend stay in the hospital and then get release I would do a bit of nesting make one room my comfo area sta slow and and let my living space grow do not overwhelm yourself
be scared be totally normal it be because you do not have the safety and security of other around both professional and other patient on the unit
its ok to feel scared your staing over be home which be a great thing you have oppounitie to do what you want when you want its all in timing you have time to do thing at your own pace every step count for something I wish you all the good
I be absolutely petrify after be in the hospital a month just take it slow it get well but every day be a victory good luck you can do it
after a week be I be scared to be home or go out anywhere I suffer from the same thing you do I can not handle be in any store unless my husband be right by I or I will freak out
any change effect we so you should know go home and be afraid be normal
I think it will only b natural to be at least a little bit scared I know I be it be just get use to the outside world again it will take time but it will fade if it get too much you can always reach out to the local crisis team for help do not b scared to do that also remember it can only get well you be not alone   x x
be it scary to be alone yes make a extreme effo    if you mzke neigh or where you r they can check on you and you they we all meed help
I feel the same way after my discharge I be disorient and not sure of myself it will pass I do hopiop afterward and it help you can always call the crisis line if you need to talk to someone to help when its overwhelming
I be sometimes scared still even though I have never be to a psych ward I have all that you have I use to give myself panic attack to the point I could not stay home alone it help if you use lavender oil to breathe in for anxiety it also help to talk to friend during the time you be scared I be available to talk when you need a friend I beat the panic attack but when my husband leave sometimes it be hard I also end up get a dog to help but if you need a friend add I and talk with I I be here
I do not know if you like animal the right now they offer and different state animal for companion I think that be the name they call and if you like animal that would be a good company for you but remember one thing the dog be go to be your company but you also get to take care of the dog really well and I have a puppy right now and I do not feel alone anymore I use to feel like without people I can leave and now I do not want people around I anymore because I do not like noise it get I very irritated when people be very loud around I or they argue and I be feel well I do not miss no one
it most definitely be normal if you have medication to take it regularly as prescribe the fear should subside
this be my question thank you all for be respectful to my question I be in the psyc ward for be suicidal   I hope that this scared feeling go away soon   I can not handle be scared to be by myself   it feel so overwhelming
I have no one to stay with I I be scared for myself
I be scared to be alone after I come out of the ward too I stay with a friend the first two night
I get a dog she be a big help but I just can not fight this feel its overwhelming feel like I be go to have a panic attack
it be completely understandable you be not alone for a full month have you try maybe get a pet they be therapeutic and can sta to recognize your anxietyhighslow good luck and you can do this
thank you for let I know that I be not alone   I do not know how to act I feel like I be go backwards this be so scary for I   feel like I be lose my grip

this be not all the time but when my anxiety be really bad I will turn the tv right down to still an audible level but a very quiet level as I can not try to get calm if its too loud
I be super sensitive to nose too I get irritated very easily to any kind of noise I never really think to tell my dr though I be on so many med I be not sure they could help w this I have no polar and anxiety disorder they might just tell I to get over it lol but for real noise be a huge trigger for I I snap out
can I just say that alcohol be the bad thing for anxiety and depression   you be not self medicate you be destroy yourself fuher   not only should alcohol not be consume with the drug you be on but it be also a depressant and can raise anxiety level especially in the hangover period   this be probably why you do not think your med be work
I have   kid and I can not handle loud noise at all I have to near silence to concentrate on the task or question at hand   ptsd bipolar ii rapid cycling anxiety   ocd
loud tv give I huge anxiety especially   when the ad come on and someone try to talk as well it cause so much stress I hardly ever have it on it be like my brain can not cope with it
try and cut out the alcohol if you can it do not mix well w meds I personally can not smoke either send my anxiety through the roof   loud sound send I up the wall especially mixed w other noise I stay clean and just take med therapy dbt also exercise   I need to eat healthy hang in there it get well
well you still should not worry   maybe she just need a bit of a break   it be very hard on they too   have we to deal with lol   we be not easy people to be around especially when we be ill tx
you need to ease up on yourself   with everything you be through that I have just read you be do amazing well   you be still work something I have not be able to go back to and you be take positive step as in go out whether you be sit on your own or not that be a brave and courageous thing to do again something I could not do   you need to give yourself more credit for the thing you be do and try not to focus on the thing that you be not as for friend I understand only too well how gutte it be when your circle get small and small   but we need to understand how they feel be around we especially when we be not do too well   my friend tell I that she be scared at time of my behaviour   and that she find it really really difficult to deal with   she could not cope see I like that   and I do get it I be terrify at time over how I be how I behave how I could not function whatsoever and how I be emotionally and mentally that be a complete wreck so I can imagine how she must of feel I be not I at that time I be a nightmare to be around I laugh one minute babble rubbish at a million mile an hour the next make no sense at all I run round like a loonatic cleaning etc then the next thing I could be cry sob scream and want to kill myself   yes we have a daily battle with ourselves sometimes just to get out of bed but we also have to look at how difficult it be for our friend and family to deal and cope with we   wish you well tx
find some suppo group so you can be around people that can help without depend so much on your friend it sound like you might be strain your relationship because you depend too much on they keep go you can do this
sometimes friend get overwhelmed when you depend upon they too much   all the advice give here be very good do not be afraid of the doctor or therapist you just need to take the time to talk to they plus group therapy might also help   you might also want to stop go to a bar where it make you feel more lonely think about other place that you might like to try I go to a library and just read a book there be lot of people around I but it feel ok and safe
doctor help with a lot and so do friend I know it feel as if everyone have desee you and I have be there but through different suppo group I have find the good friend a girl could ask for I have an ex husband and it take I almost   year to remarry because I be scared of man too however I get lucky adhd be hard to deal with I be diagnose when I be   I have a hard time adjust but thing get bad now I be on different med to help I ovehink about everything and it suck I have not figure out how to stop but I do have friend and my husband to help I have be in your shoe and do not be afraid counseling help a lot you just have to find the right therapist and the right program also lavender oil do help with stress I would recommend that I burn candle and wear a necklace I hope that help
do not be afraid of the doctor and a therapist can teach you tool to function more socially which will in turn positively affect your overall mood   good luck a lot of we truly understand stick around use we
it be ultimately your choice but personally it be the good choice I have ever make it take a while to get the right combo and the right dose but I have be do great now for about   year still have some good d aha and bad day but no where near what they use to be I can tolerate it and I like to say pull it together   when I need to it will always be a struggle but the med make thing so so much well for I I see thing so much clear now
I also struggle with bipolar ii disorder and depression and anxiety I be on abilify and clonazepan and trust I I be so much well on medication and without it when I be on the wrong dose I would have really far spread high and low but they would last a long time and now I be at a happy medium I still have high and low but everyone do not to mention the fact that I be a woman and hormone play a huge pa in my imbalance hope this help
I have bipolar one adhd and anxiety
I be diagnose with bipolar ii about a year ago I have be on med since I be a teenager but I have   never be on the right combo of med my psychiatrist be in the process of switch up my med right now I be thankful that I have be able to be on medication I have such horrible depression anxiety mania and anger before medication it be totally woh it to be on the right med the only downside be find the right combination of med it take   month for the med to kick in completely hope you can get the right combo of med
I be on medication for bipolar   you may sta to feel a mood change like you be happy one minute and   sec later you be angry with the world I do not have really hypermania but I be very depressed with severe anxiety I take clonazepam   lamicital seraline and trazodone it help a lot I be try to get the right dose my mood be the big lamictal help with that however with counseling and learn to cope with our medication help a lot but I know several people who be on medication for bipolar hope that help
my opinion you should have speak to your doctor but a lot of people with weed the same diagnosis they take medication because the way you feel I think you get to sta with a small dose do not get panic all medication have side effect especially psychiatric medication you can lusso gain weight you have to first do you research whatever the doctor want to prescribe you because that be my problem I do not know I be suppose to do my research be careful a lot of the medicine they can give you you even diabetic I do not know why I feel that way that I only want to crave sugar and fat food in greece food but a lot have to be with the medication you have to do a research because it be not easy do not get scare at the end of the day we need to get help we get to be responsible not like old they know what they have and they do not look for help so try to be comfoable with your doctor and your therapist if you need both and do you research and try your medication with a small amount of those also so you do not say that satisfied will be really bad like I use to it little by little step by step if I do not work for you it be go to take time but one day you will get the right one good luck and god bless
I refuse to take med for bp and anxiety until about two yr ago I have finally get to a point that I could not move from my bed I could not leave the house I could not take care of my child it take a bit to get my med right I have never feel so good I be finally mellow and and my thought be not race everywhere I still have the anxiety and be learn well to cope with that but my mood have finally level out and I can enjoy life and the small thing so much more I wish I have staed these year early I feel like I miss so much of life
med dbt family suppo therapy might take a while to find the right med   as time change you might be able to take less and during rough time more I have bipolar   anxiety depression ptsd and chronic illness adhd   I take   different one and I be still change the dose   but I be do good take a while hang in there good luck
I do not realize I be bp ii until age   when full blow hypomania hit I I need mood stablizer for hypomania and antidepressant for anxietybut I have get my life back and may be even become a nice person in that I be no long do mental and emotional gymnastic just do ordinary thingsin the end if you need med they will likely improve your quality of life
I take seroquel and viibryd prescribe by a psychiatrist seroquel be a mood stabilizer and antipsychotic viibryd be an antidepressant my depression be debilitate I feel both med have help I a lot but I still have problem deal with stress I take klonopin as need I just stay home a lot I can not deal with people I also see a talk therapist I feel it help a lot too
if you do sta med pay close attention to the change it make I be give an anti depressant and my manic spike so bad it almost ruin my life a different anti depressant they put I on put I through bad depression and I be still recover from the sour effect that second one make I more suicidal the third med they put I on be venlafaxine   I think that be how you spell it that one help I more than the other but eventually my husband and I learn how to cope with my anxiety depression and bipolar   the most impoant thing be have a good suppo system I honestly do not think if be here today without my sister mom and husband
I have be on med for   year they be helpful to get to know myself while I have stress go on in my life which I could not control I have extensively research   be now wean of med to eventually go medfree   control with exercise diet meditation   I be go to give it   month to wean slowly because I take   sos of meds antidepressant antipsychotic for sleep   mood stabiliser
richie ingle the less package and preservative the well fresh veggie   but routine be huge I have to set my alarm to remind I to get ready for bed sleep be so impoant for my mood
I also have bp and anxiety I choose to medicate my depressive episode get so bad it be my only choice if I want to be some semblance of well it have take I a long time to find the right combination of med but I feel for I it be the good choice I just staed go to therapy again too and that have help immensely
I have bi polar and the good decision I have make be to take the pill they help control the rage fire inside but I do not have anxiety or sddepression so the med might not work as well or even make it bad
the   good thing I ever do once diagnose be to quit drinking and sta on med it take alittle while to find the right combination stick with itgo to a therapist regularly alsoalmost   yrs laterand I no long have to take anxiety med I or med to sleepi take lithium and wellbutrin I still have symptom but the severity be less
I need medication to feel good otherwise my brain be a scary place to be
I have bipolar   and adhd I struggle along most of my life with nothing until   year ago then I be put on the right medication and it have help I so very much
all of this be sad but truei live it everyday my son do not get why I can not get up out of my room and go shopping or anything else for that matterwhen I come to my room life just stop for melike I can not can not get outhelp how do you just get up and gomy life all change in   and again last yrso much death in my lifemy big fear be the fear of death the bad
I know what you mean exactly I figure out that if I learn as much as I can the well I can explain to friendsother suppo what I want they to knowyou probably know a lotit pretty difficult to explain it to someone though some day I be so anxious I do not know what to sayto anyonelet alone explain this read thing aicleswhatever you find helpful for yourself and maybe refer they strait to that
I understand but then again the people who understand be literally so few and far between and they only understand to their good ability I hear you and you be not alone it be a tug of war struggle
you be definitely not alone I have an excellent suppo system but have people who have a hard time accept my diagnosis even though it be be confirm by   separate psychiatrist I also have bipolar disorder major depression generalize anxiety ocd edno and panic disorder many people who do not have a mental illness do not understand that all of these be often symptom of each other and be all interconnect so often people think you be either a hypocondrac or just super crazy I just tell people that I have bipolar disorder and really bad anxiety   I also understand about feel guilty you have to remember everyone be different and everyone have their own experience you be allow to feel the way you do it be not of any choosing of your own I have find that hold in my emotion and feel guilty do more good than harm I journal my emotion now and pick a person in my suppo system to confine in
nope you be not wrong I have all these and find people who will listen we all deal with some kind of anxiety etc
rosemain rodriguez calina trembly
mika haara we all die none of we get out of this alive however you be here on eah for a reason now we all have choice not to choose be make a choice life be a fight and everyone have their own fight their own pain all of we be fight for our mind there be right and wrong good and bad love and fear once we fight for ourselves we can take our experience speak to other in pain and walk along side they to pull they out of darkness but no one can want you to live more than you want to live for yourself you have the power and all you need inside you to live a great life you can not see it for some reason but there be greatness in you we all have the power to choose life   if you want to live I pray you choose liferedhea
some people be very bad at under stand those who suffer any illness to I many seem so self   righteous child be impoant so understandably a parent will be concern that they be capable of do thing the right way therefore they need a paner who be not a selfish prig not self righteous not selfish if he be so selfish   lack in under stand he will never make anyone happy so ditch he the world be full of kind gnerous   care man I doubt if he will make any one a good husband let alone a caring father
wow right now you need he more than ever struggle with depression and anxiety be not easy and when your suppose suppo network deal a blow like this it make you so so much bad yes be in a relationship with someone who have depression and anxiety can be hard but if you love that person unconditionally and be commit to they then you go above and beyond to try to understand and help they do he not think that if you just be normal fyi I bloody hate that term but you know what I mean then you would do it in a hea beat depression and anxiety be debilitate there be no two way about it quite frankly if he can not suppo you in the way you need and you do not fit his so call perfect ideal be this really a healthy relationship to be in
have bipolar disorder and be a parent myself he have legitimate concern I be a good mother I do anything I can to make sure my kid be take care ofbut there have be time that I hate to admit when I have be manic I be not the good parent I can be it put a lot of strain on my kid and my significant other he have to make up for where I be lack and that be just add stress for he with a good suppo system though and a paner who understand the illness it can be a sucessful family it take work from everybody I hope they can find a way to work out their issue and be happy
I have be with a few man who could not handle it   it be literally awful when they do not understand or do not even try on one hand he seem to be try but maybe need to try to be a bit less blunt with how he say thing to you as you be go to take it to hea as all of we with any mental illness wear our hea on our sleeve I be now with someone who understand so much more   jesus it be different my sister be the one who worry about I with child but no matter how old how drug up or how sad I be   life go on   if I have a sad day it be go to happen no matter what the situation so we have to learn how to deal with it but that do not mean our mental health be go to change I would say see how it go with the councillor   if they can not make he understand more then I be afraid he never will   maybe you need someone who will suppo you a bit more rather than tell you you will be a crap mum
back in   my mom and sister tell I I should let my daughter go stay with my sister for a little while I do because I be pregnant and could not take my med my mom and sister make a plan to have I sign paper for brianna to be able to stay for the summer it turn out they be actually adoption paper as I be off med I be confused and sign the paper not fully understand what be go on adoption be final   my sister never let I se or talk to my daughter again my daughter pass away in   from hea complication   in   my ex take my son away from I the judge state because I have be hospitalize for   week I must have be suicidal or homicidal therefore make my ex a well person to parent I have my son for   year   people make I so angry judge I for my mental health
yes corina dismang I be try and I now realize the beautifulness   illness of the struggle you go through and the many reason I be in love with you   I may not understand completely and learn and understanding you be always woh it   love you forever swee ta   
I think this be a reasonable concern for someone to have grant the way they go about it be horrible and sound somewhat biased off of basic common stereotype it be still something that could be very serious in the future if it do turn out that way when you have a kid that should be your priority and you can not allow your depression to prevent you from parent your child grant I be of the mindset where my own parent have it I have it and I have become terrified of pass it off even fuher I still think its a valid question
god forbid he have kid with a woman who will suffer from post pardom depression and any woman who have kid and become a mom be never solid   he live in a dream world of ignorance and tv land thinking of stable solidity when kid enter the picture it put more strain on the marriage and everyone life if you do not learn to work together and pick up slack for one another one be weak so the other will be strong and you will switch role every now and then
yes I have struggle many year you can overcome this with the right med good food and exercise do not give up
some of you be give terrible advice I myself have depression anxiety and bipolar so I understand that what he say hu but at the same time someone without these or similar illness have no clue what it feel like to live with they everyday he s right you need to be a strong woman to raise child but he s also try to understand and continue the relationship despite the mental illness see a counselor be a great idea to help both of you understand each other concern and position work with he and see where thing go
look you will be ok I I suffer from chronic depression anxiety and bipolar and ocd and I have three beautiful child and I be a great mom to my baby so do not let he put you down rl man do not do that but help you
he be an absolute shithead if only he know what it feel like to have anxiety of depression such a selfish man think of himself maybe he should try help you a bit   be there for you x
this do not happen to I however a lot of my anxiety and depression come from want a baby and it never be the right time now that I have my little boy and be on anxiety med I have never feel well I have this incredible zest for life   I can understand his concern and even though they hu they be valid concern that need to be address I hope your therapy session go well   there be so so so many mom and dad who deal with mental illness every day and still totally rock this whole parenting thing
I be divorce because my ex husband could not be suppoive of my ptsd life be too sho for he to judge you like that dump his ass he be not help he be just upset you
no doubt
it be really hard for people to understand also specially man when they do not have what we have I just realize now   year old why I can stay stay when a relationship and it be because no one understand and men try to control my life when they see I those day really depressed or without motivation they take advantage and situation that we pass like anxiety so I realize that it be well to be by myself right now that I be not ready anymore to people try to control my life I feel like I own my own self and if someone be not happy with I and I be not happy with that person I appreciate to be by myself and keep it move forward I feel like I know how to control my emotion well when I be alone then when I have someone I get very exciting when I meet people and at the end of the day everything be go away so why try again I be happy right now when I have a man I get very depressed I feel they demand for too much and I do not like when people sta criticize I you can do this you could do that that they say I have to be in bed you do not even know I it can be like today a beautiful day but I feel a little drowsy I would love to be sleep right now but I can have to do responsibility but right now no one be tell I not to do my responsibility if I want to I do not have to do it I do not do it but if I would have a man he would be in top of I bother my head and I really do not want to do that anymore my life I prefer to take care of my son   my dog and continue look for god that be what I want
I raise   son alone I will never say it be easy but it can be do do not be with someone that do not see your value and your woh just because your struggle with a disease you do not ask for he will probably end up be a lousy father anyway with think like this
the chance of pass it on to a child   be big   and med can cause horrible bith defect   I be bear w   I be   and be tell during my last episode not to have they and it sound like the the guy would not be much help a child be a huge responsibility even if their bear healthy   the risk of pass this on be real have you ever consider adoption I know you want to have kid but there be so many that need good home try and get your health square away it be not fair to put your want before there be med alone would cause they to suffer the world be hard enough you know this suffering be not fair for anyone you can do what you want just do your homework get the help you need first   and go from there I be sure you would not want your child to have the same thing your deal with hang in there   your woh it hope this help come from a child who have this disease that be pass down to they not intentionally   but we know more now research and weigh the odd
I do not have depression or bipolar disorder but I do have a chronic illness that make it really hard sometimes all you can do be the good you can take care of yourself it be not as if you ask to have depression or anxiety if someone can not understand and be compassionate then they may not be the right person I have lose alot because of illness include friend and romantic relationship the one that take the time to try to understand I value the most so sorry this happen positive thought send your way
I be severe bipolar every damn day be a struggle I do not do med hate the way they mess with all of my health and create more issue I absolutely force myself to get up go to work and take care of my kid I have learn to hide my depression and anxiety ridiculously well my wife pretty much never notice my struggle my ex husband however use to tell I to take another pill you be weak etc my mental illness be a huge pa of I but it do not shape who I be I be opposite of most on this post and my advice be to push yourself every single day even if you just get up and shower you at least conquer one battle one battle at a time each day and congratulate yourself on each step in the end you be the only one that will change you suppo you and stand by you maybe he be not the right guy you have to learn to love you and embrace all of you before you worry about his acceptance
walk a lot diet help too thing like turkey and chicken help with sleep anxiety be hard mine hit with change and a lot at night with dream typically I have to sit in the car and talk myself down if I be out in public at night my wife be really awesome about just hold I until it pass I do a lot of vitamin as well lol it work for I but I have to rewire my thinking and that take sometime
I rely on med you be very strong I absolutely believe in push one self the result shock and amaze you how do you cope when agitation kick in and anxiety one follow the other with I and haunt I to move end   
I suffer with depression and severe anxiety I have   child I get up for they and care for they be some day hard than other absolutely but I live for they my paner understand and we talk about it I tell he when I be down and most of all I share when I be scared he be my rock and when I need a moment he step right up your not incapable he be he want to add to your insecurity by tell you that your not solid solidity between couple be build each one put their work in you get this girl and the right solid man be out there for you
the thing you have to understand be that yes depression be mentally and physically exhausting to you but it be for they too maybe not as bad but it be I struggle with major depression and pretty bad anxiety and I be a mother of a   month old girl be a mother have help I in way that medication can not but I refuse to take medication at all so I do it all on my own   just be understanding of he and the most you can do be go to therapy do not be mad but you have a right to be upset   you can get through this both of you can    but both of you need patience
I have struggle with depression and anxiety my whole life I get your struggle however I be sorry I totally understand his text he be completely right in his concern
wow   some of the advice be give be just horrible   he be willing to go to her counselor    he be willing to express his feeling and worry   he have legitimate concern   how about give her real advice besides you should dump he he be not willing to understand   you be kid right   he be do everything to try to be there and understand   maybe you all need to be more understanding   just because we have mental illness do not mean we can wave it around like a white flag every time something go wrong and be off the hook and if we do not get let off the hook it be a chorus of oh they be not willing to understand no you be not willing to understand   the diagnosis be not a get out of jail free card for your behavior and choice   if this be the action he see every day they good on he for speak up and say his concern kid be hard work and sometimes it be go to be hard especially when depress   let we not pretend it be not
I have be in this predicament and it be take a while but hubby have come around to see the big picture it take for I to see it too I have a few lazy day then balance it out by go batshit crazy when I have the energy to go haha it really take understanding on both side for each other to get anywhere the fact he be not hold it in mean he be fight for the relationship how you go about it from here on in know this affect that let he see you be good and bad hun bipolar and anxiety   
agree one really do have to pull oneself together for one child however hard it be though I think the good pas be when you surprise yourself by do what need to be do regardless of your own anxiety or whatever one get to sit back at the end of the day and say ha I do it and pat oneself on the back it prove to oneself that one really can do it in   spite of everything the guy sound great you really should work for he he sound woh the effo
yup and let I second that kid be extremely hard they be not go to validate you or make your life well they can be great for couple but for many couple they because strain med change   adjustment no luxury for that with kidsyou do not even go to the bathroom by yourself for a couple of year if you do not have a very understanding paner to raise the kid then you be screw I do not know this couple exact situation but well he bring it up now rather than   year and two baby down the road after post paum hit hard and both be angry and sad he from resentment and she from pain which we all sympathize with of course that be why we be here I be hope his text be for an open love talk I hope the good for herfor both of they get that text must have be so hea wrench and I be so sorry but I can not knock he for at least try to have the discussion about his fear
anxiety depression bipolar disorder can be easily overcome once you understand how your mind work I have bipolar disorder myself for   year now I be med free and back to normal I be help other people overcome their issue if interested message I
I be very self aware shock the hell out of my counselor sometimes and no it be not easily overcome at any point even though I know the cope skill even though I may know why I be feel the way I be at that point even though I for the most pa understand the disorder and have do extensive research on my diagnosis it have never be easily overcome it be something that I have to work hard at daily and some day I be just too mentally emotionally and physically tired to handle much of anything I have my day when I have very few spoon to sta my day and I struggle more so on those day once again this be not something easily overcome for most people with these illness
this be why I be single with no child I have just see my fella through two year after he have a meltdown down   I help he because I know from experience what he need but early this year I run out of steam and my bipolar kick in I think he would understand my anxiety and depression as he be so recently there himself   but not a chance it be all about he and he only want I for how I can help he when he be down guess what   after a lot of heaache I be single again it take someone really amazing to understand and suppo someone close when the black dog strike
it be the truth some day I have to fight myself to be there for my kid it be a struggle but I have back up plan when there be a need for help
my fiance and I both have anxietyi have depression with anxiety his anxiety be daily and constant and make he question our relationship and make he repeat the same thing over and over my depression make it impossible for I to get out of bed talk move or even move my eye it be difficult but communication be key I hope a therapist can help you I be consider get one for I and my fiance
I firmly believe that if you be unable to take care of s child yourself do not have one bipolar disassociative disorder ptsd since I be four month old bpd anxiety I get my ass up every day and take care of my kid I know people with cancer who be in well shape than I be so yes I would say it
my husband who be very scientific struggle with understand my daughter mental illness   but one thing he do not dispute be that she be the good mom   her illness have make she even more accepting and compassionate to people need and difference   it take he some time in counseling to open his eye   let your therapist and dr help you make your decision bless you
I will be pray for you    I be go through something similar   I have be try to get a divorce since april   after   year of marriage   my depression and anxiety be use against I   he have I hospitalize several time and I have to leave for my sanity I meet a new man and everything be great until I could not control my crying   he do not understand either    I be a good kind person who help everyone else
into   year of marriage diagnose with bipolar depression anxiety   year ago my husband do not understand my illness but he separate my med go to dr but refuse to read up

I sleep well but only because I take seraquel at night also the good pa of my day horrible hey but I find each day a battle especially the morning
this suck write this because I have bipolar type   as well as ptsd but this mentality be make we sicker I say this because if we hole up and isolate stay indoor and shut out the light we be only feed our depression what it want it be impossible to get well even in the slight bit if we play this card be it hard to get out of bed for I yes do I spend soo much time in my head that I come up with the most irrational thought yup but I try to do as much as I can in a day even if I be choke back tear and want to just disappear all of we have that one personsome many more than one that depend on we breathe that alone make we special we be way too hard on ourselves at time and no one might understand our issue but someone out there love we for the mess we be unconditionally and that be beautiful
how I feel right now mood have be all over today buy mostly down and just wish my existence be go no one understand or if I try to explain I run people off it be hard to open up with people who can not and never will understand so I try to bottle up my fear and my pain
so true tell doctor medication be not work well it help with the low low but that be all   I feel so depressed and can not shake it
I be struggle too you be not alone

I have have some job that sound great at the time to find that they be meaningless pressure cooker that pay well and do not really improve the life of anyone around I even provide direct care in hospital so satisfying and the pay be fair come with a set of shackle that prevent I from do the right thing for sick people I drop out of nursing school with one semester to go I get a master in social work and be pursue counseling career at least I have something to say about the treatment plan I will take a pay cut for that
be you do what you love or what you think be expect of you after exhaust my fmla for other family member I leave my job love the job but not the politic I have a high call for my life but I have to be courageous enough to find it and learn to let the newness of life live courage be simply take your fear and move forward not allow fear to pigeonhole you in life do not be afraid to do what you love it may not be the popular thing but it will bring you peaceredhea
I also feel anxious every day go to work then I staed to look at the whole picture I really look at the thing that lead up to my anxiety during my first two year attendance be terrible and last year I be hospitalize for have a full blow breakdown   I come to realize my job be not woh the stress or my mental health I just look for another job with different advantage this may just not be the job for you right at this moment in time   but let a dr or therapist know how you feel   it may help get on an anxiety me

find a way to force yourself out of bed even if it be just to the mailbox do make your entire day different you at least make it to the couch and think about leave the house some day you end up leave some day you be then able to force yourself to do some chore especially if you have someone depend on you to do so   I know I may sound like someone who do not understand   but trust I   I do   I be there right now go somewhere and force myself thru it back home now and feel the same way however I be force myself to go to iop at the local hospital before it get so bad I need to go inpatient   this life suck but have just that one person that understand and do not judge change your life entirely   you just can not overload they or expect they to change you you have to put in the edson period and yes I agree it be the first sign it be not easy it do suck and I simply could not force myself through an   hour work day yet if you do and can my hat off to you some of we that deal with these issue be the strong people in the whole damn world even though we appear very weak to other   I be hope this group I be stae soon have my intake hearing today put I in touch with other go through the same thing   and we can help each other at this point in my life I strongly believe it be something I need in my life not just the online forum I visit when I get rough basically an accountability paner one that understand and you derstand you understand they close by so you can force each other to have a cup of coffee at mcdonald or visit each other if all you can do be make it to the couch it sound so damn cliche and it be what we hear from people who have no idea what we deal with   but the last year I have find it be true find inner strength and not pour my problem on other unless I absolutely have to have make I a strong person it sure as shit be not my medication change   if any of you be in this situation and need someone to talk to drop I a line I be at the point in my life where I want to help other it make you get out of yourself and how you dwell on how you feel it change yourlife but it be so far from be easy believe I I understand those of you who will say   he be just like everyone else if you want to talk about the very slow step I have take drop I a line I be teller you it be be baby step little baby step over and over
oh yes that be I I dislike be force my paner be rugby mad and often want I to share in he be activity omw what a strain I feel like scream out to he    just leave I alone   but it be he be   way of thinking that be what I need   
it swindle I in be in the house for almost   month straight I finally decide to fight back and take my kid out for a day of fun and end up with a fractured elbow between the depression and anxiety I have be deal with it take about a week to convince myself I could handle one day my kid have a blast so I guess it be woh it it be be a bit tough now that I be deal with so much pain and an itch that I can not scratch due to this cast ughhh I sometimes wish I could have an out of my body and mind experience just to be normal for a day and be able to cope with thing like other do
I struggle with this daily I force myself to get up because of my   yr oldi fight hard for he wish I know how to get well
I know I have the same problem and have be say sometimes I win and sometimes the depression win   it be a real struggle
I struggle to fight my way through the depression I do not want it to totally take over so I fight hard   sometimes I win sometimes the depression win but I will never stop fight the hard thing be fight alone and have no one know or understand what your go through or even care
be like this for six month cost I a marriage I wish people would know how hard anxiety and depression cam be
I have bipolar and a lot of anxiety I have   that feel   every morning lately even though I be on my med it just stae out the blue I force myself up but can not get motivated till at least be it be horrible I wish I can just be normal    hope this do not go on too long as I can not carry on like this
I too we just have to remember that there be time when we do feel normal even if it be sho live and keep our perspective that this low time will pass either on its own or with a change in meds therapy also I for one have to give myself permission to rest and be unproductive for awhile because I know that be how my body operate I have be try to go with the flow lol sometimes it work sometimes not at least we can take comfo in know that we be definitely not alone in our strugglesredhea god be here and so be facebook  
it be that consume dread feeling in the pit of your stomach   you honestly do not know if you can do it but if you be get the right help it will give you the strength to push through it   
it end my last relationship it be the good decision of my life though they be a very outgoing person I meet when I be manic so we totally click then of course   get out of the relationship and someone try to force I every damn day which only make I feel bad about myself be great for I I feel horrible about it for a year because she be a great person and have great intention but I end up feel dependent on they again that make you feel less confident get away from those who push you so hard be very impoant for your self confidence on topof that you be harm their life if you really do care about they let they go be the good thing you can do for they even though it suck   you can then find way to make yourself strong on your own at your own pace   I know that be not what you want to hear but the good therapist in the world will tell you flat out its bad for you and they only harm you both and stop both of you from have well life drop I a line if you want to k ow my entire experience   ultimately I realize I be just not suppose to be in a relationship   it be just not healthy make it hard on I and destroy the other person life as well good luck
the bad be when they think that you will feel well if you go somewhere to have a change of scenery   that actually make I bad    I have learn to compromise if they be try to get I out of bed to go somewhere say out to dinner I will get up and try to get ready if I be still too anxious to go we end up order something in that way the other person get my time and attention but I do not have to face the outside world   this be just what work for I but compromise be always woh a try I be go to
difficult pa for I be I have a paner with very similar issue as I but those issue manifest in very different way I anxiety or depression mean I shut off and get super implosive her need to talk through everything and resolve every last detail which lead to very negative result from time to time   
just ask they to seriously back off   explain yourself and hopefully they try to understand   it be be a struggle for I the last   yrs and at least mom understand I can not do everything nowadays
my daughter be bipolar and I have see first hand what it be do to she I also have a hard time deal with she she worry I because she have a   mth old son can not live with she either   I be sad been try to get her help and right medicine   sad momma here
to define mania as be happy and energetic be inaccurate there be real problem with be irritable and unable to control your pressured speech when experience a mania it be far from be happy and energetic
I be sorry to burst any bubble but the simple assumption that a bipolar diagnosis suddenly open the recipient to sunshine and rainbow to offset the total misery of depression be a frankly obscene disservice
there be so many more option for you to choose from keep search and do not give up I be on   different med for anxiety and depression together they seem to all be do the trick you will find something that work if you keep try it take I a long time but how I feel now be woh the wait you be a beautiful soul please stay with we

there ya go keep your mind active pm I if you would like whenever you be anxious or lonely
that be a great thing have he ever help relax you when you be feel anxious exercise be the good medicineidle hand
you be right pill will not cure itknowing that help because you know to expect good day and bad my anxiety get so bad my dr give I klonopin which do help but make I so tired and sleepy I use it very sparingly
I have be on effexor for about   year and it be mellow out my depression and anxiety but like today I do not feel it mellow anything out but I also know one pill be not go to cure depression
actually in behavioural therapy you slowly work your way up to more and more exposure to thing that because anxiety while you be expose to your anxiety cause trigger or situation your therapist help you practice cope skill to deal with situation the well you get at cope and the more positive outcome you have during these exercise the less anxiety you will feel combine this with the proper medication and it can make a world of difference
indeed someone who have no idea what they be do and force you against your will be never okay I be just say that positive and monitored exposure be healthy this post kind of make it sound like people should never face their anxiety I do not know just how I perceive it I guess
okay but therapy be something that the person with anxiety be willing to paake in there be consent to be gently force into the situation that cause anxiety there be no consent in a friend or family member force you to do the thing despite you say no and give a valid reason of it screw with anxiety
be not cure by avoid it either all about get the balance right and understand why we be anxious victoryhand
I have lose   friend because they feel that no one could help they they give up I can relate to they but do not want to give up I keep remind myself of what I have in my life that keep I go it be definitely not easy it break my hea to think of their family who be struggle to understand why their love one give up I do not want that for my family I do not want to stop fight despite how bad thing be I know eventually I will have the help I need to live life without pain god bless all who struggle
be that confusing moment where life be perfect around you but deep inside your hea be break confuse as to what be wrong with we why be we still not happy still not good enough to deserve happiness
you be not alone christine you have this board I know how you feel my family do not understand either I   feel like they say she will get over it not know I would if I could there be many of we who suffer which unfounatly horrible
I have the most problem with sleep too I take a sleep medicine my mood stabilizer make I sleepy and my doctor still proscribe xanax to help with my anxiety all that say the thing that have help I most be listen to guide meditation as I go to sleep and practice meditation during the day   even just be quiet for a ceain amount of time and breathe slow and easy if you have iphone there be an app call meditation studio that I really like it cost like four dollar but there be no other in app purchase
yes both of those happen when I have my anxiety attack
anxiety can cause your throat to feel like its closing also go to the dr just in case it happen to I but I be not on any medication
if you feel like your throat be close up you may want to see a doctor you could be have an allergic reaction I find out I be allergic to latuda and vistaril both of they make my throat close up and hyperventilate it feel like a panic attack but it be not
you should seek therapy before you do anything I go to therapy and learn way to deal with anxiety and depression it help a lot
when you get your panic attack be there anything you can do to help calm yourself down ie listen to music deep breathing etc
I try everything to overcome but nothing be work it work for only few time   the most irritating I feel be panic attack   I have never   face this situation in my life
do not be afraid there be help
thank you med be change last thursday   I now have to take one mid day   I be afraid I will not remember
welcome to my day the only difference be my only thought during the day especially at a job I hatebut with no transpoation to get another onei be indecisive on the good way to make the pain end come to the realization the other day that no matter which method I deal withit be go to hu as much or bad than what I have be go through all my life I do not have an answerbut with the way it look like the shtf with healthcaresafety neteven this may not have an answer for the pain question
this be my   rd day take these and I be get restless leg and very agitated be this normal and will it go away   x
upset stomach
op here I speak with my doctor and she say that I need to be work there already for I to have she fill out an ada it be a disability accommodation form which be what the company give I and I ask she if she read it because the first question be literally if name be able to do these task without accommodation there be no need to fill out the remainder of the form which then clear I to move forward with the application status   what upset I the most be that hr pressure I to disclose my mental disability despite that I say it would not get in the way of work I could be work already
bipolar and anxiety be actually include on a application I just fill out for a job I check prefer not ti answer I be stae to wonder if my hospitalization when I be   be pop up I be in il and try to get a foid card and that pop up
this be such a huge mess if it be not for the fact that I need health insurance and a new car I total mine I would be look elsewhere but I be desperate and it be within walk distance
I once have a psychological so of test before hire where they even ask you if you have suicidal thought lol   and all sos of strange question so that they could know every aspect of you which in my opinion be nothing else but manipulation those result go to the employer even if they say it be confidential haha nothing be confidential with big company what be they go to do if I say I have big anxiety treat I like a special case in case I get hire wtf anyway disclose these or not for people with high anxiety at job where high interaction and almost constant pressure be present these various disorder be go to show themselves at time whether we like it or not you can not fake it all the time unfounately haha anyway really sad case here and my point would be just do not be honest to the employer because they be only manipulator and can replace you in a second
the need to know that they will not exasserbate your condition or harm you if the job cause you harm they would be liable if your doctor do not sign it because they be worried then you should not be work
someone I love very much exhibit some of these symptom her freedom from anxiety be my great hope she deserve every happiness
and when you have anxiety panic attack recycle complete meltdown look from the outsidein and nothing you can do about get out of the area and then get calm down the good way you can without hue yourself or other
watch your child struggle with it for as long as you can rememberit be the bad have it myselfi know the struggle all too well
I agree with you   I also hate to see my daughter struggle with it   I hate the pain it cause I to have   prayer to you and your child
so true I will sit there tell myself just go no one care no one be look at you however that sense of panic I get keep my butt glue to my seat
I hate that too I get so uncomfoable be stare down in public I have to force myself sometimes to do thing like go to the bathroom because I know people will stare at I
be alone suck and be scary
depressionanxietyseasonal depression would love to connect with other that really get the struggle
most people suffer in silence too ashamed   to   ask for help do not judge a book by it be   cover
I battle it every day   horrible sickness
you continue to struggle daily with bipolar illness and this really describe your life   keep on with your therapist and your commitment for dbt   you can live despite this illness until thru research there be well answer
I struggle all the time with this its so hard to live a normal life like this
sometimes yes you should be afraid of I I be sorry to say
I do not agree with some of these like do not take it personally or there be no reason to be afraid of I if we do not want our own feeling invalidate we should not do it to other been live with bpd a long time and I have lose people I love because it be too much for their own hea to handle I do not fault they at all the majority be great though and I absolutely relate
sorry but that be not true there be a lot of people who could be with the perfect paner and not feel good enough because of their own strugglesi be one of those people that regardless I feel I be never good enough be in a relationship do not magically change that   however if you only doubt yourself when with someone and rarely ever do then yeah they be not good enough
for my depression and anxiety and the suppo of mental illness that run in my family love and peace all stay strong
I have the same situation I be introduce to a guy and find out he like I I like he too we go on a few date but I be feel horrible all I want to do be stay in bed and sleep all day I cancel our last date because I could not get out of bed that be the day I be go to tell he what be go on have not talk to he since I try contact he to get back together but he do not get back to I if they be not willing to take you for you they be not mean for you and it be time to move on
I agree cameron harman if she can not handle it you will know how she feel and can agree to keep an emotional distance between each other but you will not feel the need to actively avoid she on the other hand she may be willing to give it a go then you will not again have to actively avoid she   do you know if she have notice you avoid she do not you think she may take this to mean you really be not interested everyone deserve some happiness do not screw it up for both of you
you could even write it in a letter old school I know but it show how much you care when you hand it to she tell she that there be some thing you want she to know but be hard for you to talk about the ball will be in her cou then if she do not want to continue with the relationship do not let that get you down some people can not handle those of we with special need because it be not easy   neither one of you would be a bad person if this happen on the other hand she may be open to go fuher with youthe unknown and whatif of any situation cause we more stress than almost anything else god bless my friend
it have be a long struggle for I when I finally get my diagnosis I be in my late s it take a few more year to get the right cocktail and even then the med have have to be adjust   but I do not think I would go back the next big hurdle be to change my mindset thing will not always be so negative I can not live this way and the only way I can do that be within myself I can make the choice to be miserable or take step to change how I look at life I have live my life for   year be miserable it be time I change that I have an amazing suppo system that be help I
yes it suck pun intend it be hard to take it be humble to be dependent and it be a pain to remember and it be scary to fear run out and on top of all that it be expensive but medication keep I stable and I feel that it be woh it in the long run untreate my bipolar disorder make my life chaotic and unproductive not to mention terribly painful be sane be priceless and I try to be thankful that there be a treatment for my condition
this be true especialy for bipolar both therapy and med work well I have bp and anxiety and have be able through year of therapy learn coape stratgie and recognize when an episode be come right now I be not on medication for either because the therapy have be sucessfull I still have issue sometimes still see my therapist and doctor to make sure I stay ok but I have be able respond in a healthy way and avoid trouble
rebecca sokol I never forget about that word that you say if you would have have diabete I use to have a therapist tell I that one day think about you have ibt and if you do not take your med you will die sound bad day I get so scared because they tell I they can cut any pa of my body so for many year now I be take my med but I still feel bad because my daughter have the same illness and she do not want to take her medication and we do not have no more communication she lose all her friend she lose one of her job now she be on another job because she do not want to take med but you be right we need to take our met and think about we have diabete god bless you sweetie goodnight
I do not know you well enough to tell you alot but I be goin through the same thing like I be on different med for bipolar depression and epilepsy but none of they work so I stop take they and I be still struggle with it so I know what you mean
I struggle with depression alot if you need someone to talk or anyone do do not hesitate to message I I be usually up late so even if it be late shoot I a message   
kay honey you be not alone I know how impossible it be when you try to function like a normal person but your body just physically can not and you feel like shit physically which make you more depressed which make the pain bad and it be this whole madden cycle of seemingly endless defeat I know I be right here in this darkness with you when you have to battle your mind and body just to achieve the simple task thing other people would never even think twice about but you be still valid there be still hope because there be shit that can be do to make it well to make it manageable just one step at a time one obstacle at a time one diagnosistreatment plan at a time be admit be a great first step in achieve that esp if you feel like you may harm yourself you can be in a safe place   and assess all of your issue with a team of professional to comeup with a comprehensive plan to treat body and mind and if they do not have the proper specialist in hand I be sure someone there would be able to refer you to someone or point you in the right direction and I know it seem scary but a hr hold really be not that bad it be actually really helpful and stay long can ensure you be regulate properly on all the right med and the drs can make sure no side effect and everything be good and usually there be a social worker who can talk to you about your live arrangement and if they be okaysafe workdisability   suppo group and even bridge the gap with your family I have be through this paicular wringer a few time and you really do come out well in the end it be like create a new solid foundation to build a new well life and you on with the proper suppo in place because you be not alone and you do not ever have to be there be a whole swarm of people wait to help you at your local hospital love and we be all here   I be here we gotchu please I urge you to consider go in immediately and self admit if you be have suicidal ideation even if you be not have those thought at the moment   it be still a good idea to go in just because you can have a sense of peace around you be still for a few day to regroup you can address all of your issue both mental and physical with the drs get med soe out and just stabilize it be such a good place to regroup for move forward anyway sorry for babble on I just hope you be okay honey   I want you to okay and safe and well you can message I if you want       
thank you I need to hear this I will consider this step a lot more seriously now but I want to try fight a bit more on my own just for a bit long I want to see if I can get through but I will not hesitate if it get that bad again thank you
I suffer with ptsd anxiety depression and bipolar for over   year now I have be battle since then I want to share my new ink love your tattoo thank for share

I have be off my med since november I know I need to get back on they but I be so afraid of the reaction I have be experience to they I be bipolar with ptsd I have be on med for   year at first the med seem to work great but eventually I sta hallucinate lose sleep or cycle thru mania to psychosis I talk to my drs about these issue but usually they just prescribe another med that supposedly treat the side effect I also have severe ra and progressive ms try to maintain both physical and mental health be overwhelming I know I need to get back on some med for my mental issue but I be not very hopeful that they will help any advice or new med that might help
I be on methadone   different antidepressant a mood stabilizer and a pill that help with the body temperature side effect of the methadone   all that and I still get depress anxious moody and drug craving   I wish I could take a month off of life and raise   kid to get off of all that but I can not right now the mess help I to continue on with life and my responsibility but I hope some day I be the near future I can be medication free
I be on   ned for severe bipolar one anxiety and adhd it make I so thankful to have an awesome psyc dr who really care and help I without the mess I would live in hospital
when an episode hit I I get down on the fact I have to take pill to be almost normal but I be grateful that I can pick through my thought   of the time and when I can not it be bad so I be grateful for my med I be also ptsd bipolar   and anxiety I do not miss the nightmare and terror so I tell myself if I be asthmatic I would not be ashamed to have my inhaler so why do I need to be ashamed of med that help my brain disease another way to look at it
I take   different type of medication for anxietydepression I hate the fact that I rely on they to feel normal but then I think of the alternative and I be grateful to have find medication that work for I
use to happen to I all the time when I just get over a really long manic episode it wear off the more stable I become it be frustrating and scary good luck just be patient with yourself
I get bipolar disorder   and ptsd and I do not know lately what be go on with I I use to be very friendly look for friend always give oppounity to people to be in my life but right now I really do not want to socialize at all I go to the street and speak with everyone and treat everybody good but when it be about people ask I for my phone I sta lie to they because I do not want to have friend out there I just realize that all the time make people and they know what I have or have to tell they what I have right away they sta treat I differently and I be get tired about then I bear by myself and I be bored with it tween why should I have to care about what other thing about I all the way I be I prefer to be alone even man I be sick about it what I leave in the bronx new york they call woman crazy if they know you get bipolar they do not have respect and I do not have time to get upset I prefer to be alone for happy
I actually recently hear that you can have ptsd w dissociative feature I have have this happen if you do not remember something and be worried about it if you feel comfoable ask about what happen could help ease your mind a little
one thing that help with my social anxiety be to pick out one thing a person say to follow up on or ask about I fear the awkward silence and pause I also like use positive sentence staer like oh really that be so awesome or wow I really like that   I do not experience blackout the way you be describe but I do often find I talk in circle when I be anxious
I will constantly black out mid conversation or forget what I just finish say it get bad when my anxiety be trigger which will always trigger my agoraphobia
unfounately I be not sure what to tell you about your housing situation I do not know where you live and if social service will help but if your really worried about your housing situation maybe you can try and get into a shelter it may not be ideal but it be well than be homeless for the most pa I know that sound like bad advice and I be sorry I do live in two shelter myself I do not enjoy it but I do take step to well myself there and hopefully you can too and as far as the relationship go maybe you can talk with your ex boyfriendfriend and see if he be still willing to give you emotionalsocial suppo I know it be hard because one or both of you may still have feeling but it might be woh a shot but if your too nervous to do that you can reach out to I I be a great listener and I really like to make people feel well and open to I just some food for thought I will not be offend if you do not want to
thank you monica I be able to talk with the people where I be and all be good I be just really fragile right now from the way that everyone else have treat I that I be afraid they would do the same thing as far as the date thing I want to talk about he do not leave I to figure it out by myself thursday seem to be back to our old friendship but in a new well fresh way with he be more ready to sta date I have just be frustrate in the waiting and try to cope with the pain of lose my friend when I have have alot go on and need social suppo
in read this I realize again how lucky I be when I become so I will my employer want I to get well I put a huge strain on my co worker and they work tirelessly to accommodate I I finally give up and quitsome people be not so lucky I be sorry for that in your case also I have a therapist that know exactly what to do again extremely lucky my dr the nurse all of they there be program like respite or maybe if you can trade housekeeping for a room or caregiver until you find your way s securitydisability I be quite sure you be not ask anyone to solve your problem its hard sometimes when a person be overwhelmed to be so perfect in explain what they need from other happen to I all the time I give up the date world a long time ago its to difficult for I personally I be not even close to be ready for that for you may be different probly not the good when you meet in treatment so many intense emotion be share can trick you into think its love not impossible though I think they call it trauma bond also exercise do not help everybody keep ask for help and you will find something that work for you
thank you heather you have no idea how much I feel loved read this right now I be able to talk with the people where I be and all be good I be just really fragile right now from the way that everyone else have treat I that I be afraid they would do the same thing as far as the job I know the new one be a problem and have to go because my health be more impoant so I quit my therapist be wonderful and I do the work outside session therapist have say I actually process too much as for the date situation thursday seem to be back to our old friendship but in a new well fresh way with he be more ready I have just be frustrate in the waiting and try to cope with the pain of lose my friend when I have have alot go on and need social suppo my counselor have actually not discourage I from never be in a relationship but to be cautious and let it happen when I be in a good place and willing to work at it he think the suppo would be good for I
I   think your be to hard on yourself stay in treatment and keep try w the med focus on you and your recovery stop worry about everything and everyone else take a deep breath exercise get out of bed for awhile you can always go back to bed but I fin if I shower and get ready for the day I feel much betterjust take some I time your woh it hang in there I know first hand it be not easy but you can only change you
stephanie thank you for again remind I that I be sick unfounately the rest of life do not stop just because of an illness and personally I want to overcome it which mean learn to cope with problem not excuse they I be specifically ask for help on the housing relationship and date situation which I admit my responsibility of bad thinking and where it be come from continue to ignore problem that include other people only make they bad I do not need to be tell I be worry about everyone else when I be actually worry about myself be homeless and alone wonder if you actually read what I write at least you get I work on my junk again now if only I can figure out how to face it

I can totally relate I have lose so many friend and have push so many friend away because of the depression or the manic episode where I get easily irritated no one get it but a few of my friend who have similar mental illness it be so tough to explain to someone who do not get it I can not just shut it off it will never go away even with all the medication and therapy I have have it still remain there just wait to pop up again and grant the medicine help and therapy help but nothing can stop it completely and you be just so stuck try to fight it off the good you can
hopefully she will get well and not bad   I wish I have be on anti anxiety med when I be a teenager and in college because anxiety and panic attack be crippling and a lot of problem come from severe anxiety as a young person

its good that you be seek help those memory flashbacksfeeling be not easy to talk about you might try line up some trust friendsfamily to help you if you feel uneasy usually its a week or so until the next appointment make a plan call someone to come sit with you talk to you on the phoneonce you have settle in to how it work it should get a little well if you get on youtube and searchwhat to do after a therapy session it should give you some mental health tipsonly look at the one with license therapist or professional
I feel like talk about it help you more I do not even have to talk about anymore my therapy at soca my daily basic problem because it be really good to talk about we people they know my abuser and the more painful bad when my family do not care even they know there be my brother he be a doctor a dental dr and everybody know he as a serious man in the community but because my family do not suppo I he get away with but it be fine for I because now I be leave a well life but people that I want to understand and believe what I be say it be the witness that could not say nothing before and they suppo I not my family will people for my town they tell I they know what be go on but they be so scared about this guy because he be the president of my country really close friend and dominican republic if you do something wrong you could kill nobody care about it that be what I be come from I never go back to my country for almost   year let we talk about it with your therapist or anyone that be in the same situation be really good and help you a lot my god bless everyone of you to be abuse
in my experience I be against open the can of worm and very frightened about face my demon from the past but now five year on from opening up and twenty five year on from the major issue I know it have to happen   never deal with the issue properly mean it just smoulder just below the surface never go away never be properly address   yes it be tough yes it be painful but I believe we can not truly move on and build a future until the issue have be face head on   the counsellor or therapist will be train empathic and non judgemental they will gently help you through the whole process together until you can come to be able to process the difficult issue effectively so you can properly rebuild and regain your life you do not deserve to suffer anymore x
sometimes we can be so afraid of thing get bad that we do not do the thing that can help we get well   the problem with ignore trauma be what we will not deal with do not go away it will only make thing bad and bad over time you can do this
would you look at that another phobia to top my exist one

if they have you on medical leave and you will be pay then I would take this as a blessing do not stress on it but rather take this time for you and get well
I be   the mother of   autistic kid under the age of   and I have bpd bipolar and clinical depression   I be not force on leave but I be on medical leave right now and honestly it be the good thing that be help I so far if you feel the need to go out and work I would look around for cash job like yard maintenance or stuff like that and if you find yourself on a day you can not get out of bed well stay in bed guilt free do not stress about not be at work I know it be hard as fuck but try and take it as a break from reality and responsibility and focus your energy on heal yourself
my hea go out to you nothing be more bad than your daughter tell you that you scare she this be after fight with my ex because he say he would pay for my med then change his mindwell I soe that out you have bad day do not crucify your self forgive your selftell your self that you love your self I be also sick of fight just to make it through the day but the positivity in I will not allow I to give upso darling you can not give up too xxx
I do not know what advice will help but know that you be not alone we all know struggle like these and most of we would hug you if we could hang in there try to do something for you
for he and the guilt apologize say it be not his fault honestly it be not yours either it be just the emotional roller coaster you go on when he ask what he can do that will help because he love you and our paner always want to fix it even if there be nothing they can do say something simple say he be there and just listen help because it do sometimes say sometimes you will just need a hug so you can cry because you will but if you be in a space where you can not be hug it be not anything he should take offense of it be just sometimes it be too much stimulation and anything extra can make it bad be there anything he can help with that might help with some of the stress you be feelingjust every day thing maybe you need some extra hug maybe you need just a moment where you be able to lie in his arm and just read or something maybe he could help with some chore not sure of the dynamic of the household you be in maybe you guy could go out on a walk together somewhere where there will not be a lot of people and it can just be you two and maybe you dog or kid if you have any a simple nature trail can do wonder if you just get away from everything even for like   minute it be not huge thing but it can help it will not just help you but it will help he feel well because he will feel like he be do something to help you because that be all he want it be just sometimes those we live with do not realize they can not fix it and it do not necessarily need to be fix though god we wish it could be but just some simple thing can relieve the pressure so much I be hope thing even out for you
remember you be not alone sometimes it just take a little searching to find someone who understand and will help you and listen with no judgement remember you be a warrior that though there seem to be more bad day than good those good day be go to be bright and well than anyone else in the world have because we warrior fight hard for those good day we feel they strong you be a beautiful person take a breath breathe in relaxation and relax the stress as you breathe out you deserve the brightness so fight that dark away

hirap po pala ng anxiety eat
yung panic phobia      
you know what be worstwhen you trust someone enough to talk about you struggle and they simply reply there be far more bad thing in the world than what you be suffer from get over it do not act like a child and then there be than tone in their voice and look in their face that be tell you that you be do all these just for attention and you be lazy             right now I be not use any medication but I feel like I be get stupider day by day I forget most simple task like change my clothe when I want to go out side or I can not tell if I be wear a sunglass or notmy head spin sometimes when I wake up I feel pressure in my brain sometimesi be confuse most of the time
keep you kid safe first you may also be if it from counseling if something happen to you or your child   you run the risk of lose they you can still try and helpfrom a distance until he decide to really get help
you be in a difficult situation and that be you be a   person who be be mistreat you your husband be probably fearful of go to see a therapist as it be admit that he actually have a problem there be also the fact that you need to protect yourself and your child if you do leave he again perhaps it may be a good idea not to go back until he have see someone otherwise you will be go round in circle and there will be no resolution I be sure you have think of this yourself and I be sure you go back because of persuasion and the fact that you love he thing will only improve when he have see someone and receive some help I hope this help you
I be in a some what similar situation I leave someone I care about a lot but it just get to the point be the relationship be destroy I and my life she be currently hospitalise as cruel as it sound it be give I calm and time to repair financial damage but the amount guilt be unreal   I really do not know what else to do for she she have   kid from previous relationship that be now with the dad she be run up serious debt at the same time as emotionally and occasionally physically rip I to piece   appreciate there be no benefit to you but I can relate to a degree
I would get a restraining order if he be abusive and make a request to the cou that he seek therapy and be on his medication before he can come home and have proof of completion before you divorce if he do not then consider it also prayer help forgive he that be for you the more you be hold grudge and be bitter the more the therapy will not work also get he the book bipolar for dummy make a family plan how to be a suppo system make sure he know that his child be predispose to bipolar disorder because he have it but if the kid be not show symptom they can reduce the chance of show symptom by reduce stress in the environment something be stress he out and it need sto be address in a calm manner before his child be effect permanently by this toxic environment
yes totally half of my own family just do not understand how hard it be   deal with this crap on a daily basis they just give up on I and I be so tired of be tired but especially when you already feel scared and alone all the time then your own family give up on you
I suffer from anxiety and I do not want to die I just feel like I hate this existence mean everything feel so empty so monotonous everyday same crap work home chore   errand etc have to deal with drama and problem all of that people be so selfish and cruel I hate it I get I down like why be life so boring and such a drag I be not sure if I be depressed but I know I lack fulfillment everything be just blah and meh nothing exciting just one day after another I want more out of life than this we have one life why waste it work until I be dead
this have be on my mind quite a bit for the last several month my elderly roommate be catholic and elderly do not want she to find I with her husband die three year agoif I put a bag over my head or slice my throatwrist having lose my vehicle because of a blow transmission and have to ride a bicycle to work without stroke out I think about let a car hit mebut would not want someone to face that guilt the rest of their life I look at my job pump gas at a grocery store and wonder how the hell I get to this point and if I can make enough to make it patime when no one else will interview I be a doctor who fan know he be a character on a tv showi wish he be real and to take I on one trip onlynever to come back to this planettimeplace where people would want I around and to love I where I have never be love before no matter what I hearno one would miss mesince I know no oneexcept for my roommate and her dog
I get like this badly in the winter and mildly around my period it be horrible
unfounately all too often it be such a horrible feeling and I can never make it go away  
so much go on in personal relationship financial situation feeling of   they would be well off without I to worry about how do you deal the good way for someone to heal who be you be near   dear and your last reason for be alive without destroy their future          
yes I have be there alot and through out my life   I be always self harm   want to die   I even take it to the extent to overdose on some pill s for anxiety but you kno w what if you get the right help you be thought will clear your anxiety will slowly down but seek help first
I be go through a major depressive episode right now thing in my personal life have blow up and I do not know what to believe anymore for I I have begin to disassociate I find myself just sit and then my whole body feel just huge big and big can not feel a thing it be so scary I worry some day I will not be able to bring myself out of it I be try so hard right now
all the time and when you try to tell someone that they get scared and think you be think suicide but you just want a break from yourself and all the mental baggage
all the time its like my entire life be a battle I have a wonderful hubby but then I feel so guilty why should he suffer I have a wonderful son and a lovely daughter in law I know I should feel thankful but I feel like I drag everyone into this dark space
I feel that well more or less he do not understand it like yesterday I stae crying and it make he feel helpless because he could not help I which make he feel inadequate
I feel this way also   it seem so unfair that my husband have to be strong for I I feel so guilty it be an endless cycle
and it kind of make you feel like a crappy person when you think if other in the world who do not have a family or home or ecti think it be good to know we all have our own struggle either emotional physical mental spiritual we all have something go on and it be good to accept it especially with anxiety just sit you know this be a mess up feeling but just because it be today do not mean it will be tomorrow
I only like it because I can relate like life could be so much bad and I actually have a nice life and amazing love one so why do I feel this wayand it really do make you feel guilty
I be never a religious person at all I mean I believe something be there but do not know what and then I get appendicitis grant not the same thing as that and after that I have just be so anxious and I feel like god maybe use that experience to draw I close to he because I stae pray and ask for himi have not pray in a while though and feel rather guilty about it
latelly I have be in this kind of state of mind I be not emotionally strong and if something go bad my anxiety sta kill I day by day and my tought of want do disapear and not exist emerge its sad and horrible but I know it will pass today I have an anxiety attack and all I want be to isolate myself and disapear sorry my english big hug warrior
sweetie do not worry english be perfectly fine trust I when people try to correct I over here I do not pay no mind I use to get mad but not anymore
I would sit here and say how sorry I be for you but that would do you a disservice this be your life the hand have be deal it be time to call and show your card that be the thing though show other your hand talk about what hus define your feeling be difficult I be sure but you can describe the emptiness the loneliness and I be not just talk about a therapist tell everyone in your life I know how terrifying that prospect can be but just think about it for a moment you live with fear every day fear of your own thought your urge or simply interact with other the fear here be be judge but even if you be would that really be bad there be a saying almost a mantra for we no one be hard on I than I so really what damage can tell people how much your suffering and how little control you have you toure yourself far more than any huful judgmental comment however maybe just maybe you will find someone who get it maybe your suppo system will grow the people who get your pain but instead of tell you to get out of bed and deal with it they lie down next to you and hold you sometimes love and suppo can be just as effective as med
my cousin suffer from depression and when her attack begin she text I and I rush to her house even her husband can not comfo she she tell I I be all her hope no pressure and I can only understand she I be kind of ok with this pa of story but when I feel really bad and sink into darkness of my thought and depression and be gasp for a tiny comfo then anxiety hit mead I text she she reply a day after or so ask if I be ok why I can not do the same maybe I be not compassionate as I think I be maybe I be just a selfish idiot who feel well help other and be use that to feel good and be pretend that be good person oh my mind be so complicated and be always up and run create idea and theory I feel like it be try so hard to explain everything that most of the time be mistaken I be too tired of think but I can not make it stop I have a secret that be kill I down and it be that I be homosexual and no one knowsi feel lonely and really in pain mental and physical I also have a nasty ib that will not leave I alone sometimes I think my problem be too complicated to be solve   by   I need a solution that can help I to sta with a clean new state
I can so relate to how nemo be feel right   it be be a few week and the constant stress and lack of suppo do not help

that be a tough one sweethea if you be over   you only need your parent suppo not permission you should never have be give an intern only in the first place they work under the supervision of licensed personel try to obtain information on the therapist they have and request the one you want you may have to go through a few to find the right fit only you will know that   if you feel uncomfoable unsafe in any discussion or see or feel no improvement you can talk with your therapist or dr about the need for hospitalization if you feel time be of the essence check yourself in they will usually begin and monitor any medication you may need as well as counseling and suppo from other like you do not be afraid also consider all the option in your area for treatment   if you be not   you need someone to talk to your parent for you as it do not appear that they see the impoance of your receiving treatment maybe you have a school counselor teacher or another family member who can speak on your behalf in my experience clergy and psychological treatment do not mix well they be separate faith be very impoant I can not express enough how vital early intervention be to recovery the old you get the hard it will be   whatever you do do not give up on yourself or other I wish you the very good good luck

I do not have bpd I be diagnose bipolar   with many many other thing but I have a paner who may have it though he live somewhere currently where they have a horrible mental health system as be really bad at diagnose so we be not positive there be some type of med that help mood stabilizer be supposedly the select few that can cause some relief with bpd but I definitely recommend dbt and therapy if you do not   already but until you can do it   there be a lot of thing you can do for yourself for now find thing that help you obsess in a positive way I also write but I write not only about what I feel but in my novelswhich help be obsess productively I also have my animal which need constant care every day and I rehab a lot of animal so that help a lot with give I something I be constantly research about they because I enjoy it there be many other thing you can do just for every day stuff walk or just any exercise yoga have be an extreme help for I just find what work for you be really really impoant
one thing to remember be that you be not lazy when I get to a point where I just could not do simple task anymore I call myself lazy and just feel bad and bad about myself only when I find the right med or the right med for now do I realize how much well and how much different I feel I realize that I have not be lazy and that it be the illness attack I with all it have I realize that there be a difference between be sick with the flu etc and have a horrible day with depression when you be sick you can get out of bed and take care of yourself when you be in a low sometimes you can not do those thing and that be okay you be alive and you be fight to win so always think more of yourself then the voice in your head say you be not lazy
first ask your self the question what be impoant to you have you always feel like this with your job be this a new thing be some outside source contribute to your stress new relationship family drama do you like this challenging job the good thing to do in a stressful situation be vent get it all out of your mind if there someone close to you to talk about this thing I see a therapist so sometimes venting help I go into that room with a variety of thing on my mind and come out calm I do not have a solution right away but I be just less stress exercise help a lot even if it run for a sho distance bipolar or not we all experience high stress at work just because you have bipolar do not mean your force to be in a situation you should not want to be take day off might give you an idea on how you will feel if you do not have this job I text my self in a stress situation so I know what be my trigger because we easily forget what upset be then I go over it with my therapist change when we have a mental condition can be more difficult to deal with as anxiety go up depression episode might emerge it be ok to be stress do not be hard on your self   I take medication so it keep I balance sleep on your decision you might feel differently the next day   we be only human and sometimes we be self be our bad enemy do not look for perfection it do not exist one day at a time   we tend to think of tone of fake senecrious that be more like not to happen    I wish you the good and I sure you will make the right decision for yours self because you know your self good
its very common to struggle with work I be not a great employee it do not take much to tap out
I feel the same way sometimes I do not think people understand how hard it be have this bipolar disorder try to function day to day can be a struggle our mind need a break
for I quit mean I be let the bipolar win and I be be a slave to my diagnosis my work be what keep I from be send to a psych ward work help to focus I on something other than my illness sure my focus be not great and my work be sub par in my book I be still be productive and keep up to deadline otherwise I would just be sit at home dwelling on how crap I feel and that lead to a huge pity pay for   and that be s place I just do not want to be if you need to take a few day off as a break then do it I have the next week off just so I can recharge my battery I have self care plan get my nail do have lunch with my sister go for a coffee date with my father and go shop for a new mattress then the rest of the time I can sleep watch tv catch up on netflix that kind of thing with all that say I say just do not quit
you have make yourself a victim instead if accept you have depression or another mental health issue and deal with the positive as and web they present themselves   thus could mean do something which make you totally uncomfoable but do it for your own self esteem and positive mindset I be still on medication I still shut myself away I still shun pay and get together but occasionally I bite the bullet and so far by attend because I have make the decision todo so I have not encounter any major breakdown   inwardly I give myself a pat on the back for achievement
I have often think that have a mental illness separate someone from the rest of the world I feel it be as though you live almost alongside people but almost in a bubble or a parallel existence never really gel or fitting in   I be try to find the word to describe how it actually feel as I be wonder if that be kind of how you might feel   it be almost as though the rest of society be bubble along and the sufferer be almost on the outside look in   try desperately to belong and be accept but never achieve this   it be exhausting and sad at the same time as we feel cut off and lonely as well as different and misunderstood find people who really understand be few and far between   I think only those who be suffer or who have suffer in the past truly understand although of course those other who be really struggle have to put their energy into their own survival unfounately society as a whole do not get it   it be a cry shame that the world have little patience or acceptance of mental health problem or disability   these two massive group of people as still not treat as equal with very little compassion by the masse and government alike   however much society try to show it understand and be try to suppo we consideration and understanding come far too sho of the mark   people have not get time everyone have their own problem time management issue and life in essence it be each man for himself so those who may need extra help be leave almost forget and leave to cope essentially on their own many people just do not understand mental illness at all I be not say that they all do not try because some do but in a way you can not blame they mental health problem do not make logical sense to the sufferer quite often let alone those who can not understand how it work   my husband once say to my son if you want to go to the pay why can not you go ie my son desperately want to go but his acute anxiety stop he   so sad for he but equally sad for his father who do not comprehend why sometimes the only true suppo can be find from like minded people   have you find any suppo group you could visit other sufferer usually understand and do not judge   in society we be judge there be still stigma and we can be regard as different and therefore difficult but infact it be usually the opposite we be far more thoughtful more in touch with how we tick more insightful caring and understanding it be hard though to find the right people quite often sufferer only end up with a very close circle of family and friend I have lose many over the year paly because people probably find I hard work and paly because I push they away and do not make the effo never instigate social engagement but often the people who stick by you through thick and thin be the one that really matter do you have any suppo in other way such as medication or counselling cbt etc with regard to the feeling of not want to be here that totally make sense   often it be the feeling of not fit in be so lonely and just exist rather than live to escape this unbearable and exhausting drudge day after day which be so awful to escape this in the right sense be to get well I think we all crave contentment and peace but the long road to recovery can seem so far away and it can feel such a mountain to climb but it be possible a well life be realistic but it do take a lot of resilience determination and time   small but significant step be necessary but can only do by put lot of thing in place such as a healthy diet sunshine a little exercise suppo from a range of people and professional possible medication meaningful activity but to sta with just little and often etc etc it be almost like a plan but it be not easy but the result be both life change and necessary take one small step at a time make achievable goal which you can then congratulate yourself on be kind to yourself reach out to those who care it be a sign of strength if you can do that   we all deserve to find that inner peace well wish x

I now understand that just because I be feel suicidal or plan my own demise do not mean I want to die suicidal ideation be a symptom of mental illness so just because you be dwell on it do not mean you be go to act on it having say that depressed people do commit suicide so you need to have some strategy to help you through those thought   seriously   if it be not for my kid I believe I would have opt out long ago they lose their dad to cancer as kid so I use that to remind I what it would do to they if I die by suicide I be a christian so I keep remind myself its not my job to decide how   when I die god have that soe I have several close woman friend I can call on if I be feel really dark two of they have experience severe depression so get where I be at when I be this unwell I have an excellent psychiatrist who be only a phone call away if I be feel unsafe she will admit I into hospital until it pass or she be satisfied I be safe to return home I live alone   for some distraction help I find this only help if I be well enough   have a list of thing you can choose from that will distract you from your negative thought mindfulness   bring yourself back to now forget the past too much rubbish do not think ahead too scary light a candle play some positive music   just breath   different thing work well for different people hopefully there be some thing amongst all these comment that might help blessing  
I have struggle daily for year with suicidal thought every morning I wake up and ask myself if today be the day I keep the local crisis line phone number close at all time I try to change up my routine even the slight I sleep for day straight I will sit in a public place alone but still surround by bystander and I even just randomly visit friend so I be not alone   the bad thing when feel suicidal be isolation be alone with your thought that only lead you in one direction be dangerous   do not ever feel afraid to reach out you do not have to be explain why just do not try and work through it alone   be well
suicide be a permanent solution to a temporary problem I be   and I have attempt to commit suicide I have have thought about it since junior high I be hospitalize   month ago and I be hospitalize twice so my first time be november and I be hospitalize in tijuana mexico they be not kind to you over there if you be a teen in the tijuana mental health hospital it suck cuz I spend my th bihday at that hospital then I get release november   then a month later I be take back for aggression so I be there for a month from december january   so I spend christmas and new year there I will never get that back and I remember the huge stomach pain of anxiety because I think my life be over and my family be go to abandon I but eventually the psychiatrist let they visit I and hope be bring back I get out after like a week of that visit and then the second time of get out of the hospital I feel so much more depressed I be very open and honest about the intrusive thought of harm other or kill myself cuz I want to go away and the hospital would just tell I to control they and that the medication will work eventually it do not so for the first time ever I begin cut I begin to get threaten by my family and other to get the police call on I cuz of my action and behavior that I could not control I be like this for about two or three month after the hospital I tell myself I could not die no matter how much I have urge to jump off the bridge as I walk to college or jump infront of a car I just could not let myself die no matter how much I want too so I keep go through treatment it do not work the medication or therapy so then in san diego my brother and his girlfriend discover dbt therapy and at the same time when I stae my semester in college again I get help from the school psychologist and then I see like two different psychiatrist and psychologist until they come to the conclusion that they do not believe I have bpd like how the hospital diagnose I with that but that I do have severe ocd like they say so this really great psychiatrist do a med change and I immediately have my thought of suicide disappear most of they and they do not make I freak out anymore if they show up combine with stae dbt two month ago it work miracle I just finish my first official semester in college and I get all as except one c I have to withdraw my first semester from most class and get an incomplete for one class so that be why I consider this semester an official one I be really great for   month of course not all day will be good but I no long feel like kill myself up until last week where I be very emotionally overwhelmed by all that have happen to I in my past and I dwell on it and my mom be a very toxic person on I so I have a crisis and my impulse be to grab a knife and slice my throat I could not because I be scared and the knife be not sharp enough just big and then so a few day later for the same thing of be emotionally overwhelmed I impulsively cut myself two day but I talk about it in dbt therapy and I use the skill they have teach I and I get very productive I promise myself I be go to practice my guitar every day stae this week and I already learn two song I write a lot of poetry that help express what I feel and I actually make a page because I want to make it into music and I have many design to make clothing and I want to be recognize in the future by my writing and clothing and I want to be a voice of inspiration to other who suffer as well so I always keep that in my head that I need to grow and prosper and achieve my dream and once I get there and if I make a lot of money I be go to fund shit for mental health and keep on try to be a voice people can relate to or get hope from I want to prove to all the people that bully I and treat I like shit and cause I trauma that I be not just a typical whatever guy I want to be someone big and successful and I know my family be not completely functional but I can not leave they either I would ruin their life too so I try to remember all that stuff and even though I dwell on the past a lot and feel so much hatred and anger towards those who hu I who be a lot of people and all I ever beg for be an apology that I will never get except for one girl I use that as motivation to make sure that I be go to prove they wrong one day like muhammad ali I be about to show you how great I be so even though I do hu myself this last week my thought mostly disappear I listen to very mellow music that make I happy I write I play video game I work out and every day I try to achieve a goal no matter how small to feel that I be woh something and close to grow big and close to the person I dream to be that be how my suicidal thought have go away but I live hell for year specially   and the beginning of
suicide do not end the pain it just pass it on to someone else I do not know who say this but its true yesterday be the anniversary of my husband mother suicide she commit suicide one year after our marriage I see what it do to he so even through I be super suicidal deal with bipolar depression and anxiety I just think of all the pain I have be pass onto my husband and three kid so when it get so hard to breath and I just want it to end I think of they and I stay
I have come to the point where I realize that those thought be a just symptom that be pa of my condition and like any other symptom I try to address the source I know the source be my brain chemistry and that it be hereditary and I accept that it be an illnesscondition I will have for the duration I let it wash over I with the knowledge that it will pass some day be much hard than other and some day I literally have to give myself permission to lie down and go to sleep I find that sleep usually not always but usually straighten out my thinking know what be be though and know the pattern and accept my condition on its term and mine help it do not make it easy nor be I happy that this be my struggle but it help
suicide ideation can be   extremely scary for a person especially as the thought can be very vivid and often out with person control it    do not neccessarily mean that the person be go to attempt suicide   although not always case and I have in the past but mostly they be a reflection of person emotional distress   I have have time when these thought and image have be   almost be unbearable I try and distract myself do something   physical to get through unfounate ly do not always work and I have resoe to self harm at time but not as frequent as before
my kid and med I will not lie and it get easy but with suppo you can get well now I think of my grandson that I want to be there to meet I realize I can not leave my child in this world alone I have high and low but I just tell myself that if I be go my baby will be split up and they will be destroy because I leave they for reason they could not understand if you do not have kid just think about all the thing that you want to do despite your darkness and how those thing will never happen if you go through with it trust I I be sit in my car on a dark road   week ago and think that I might as well because I be so tired of deal with the depression and anxiety take med see doctor but my child and husband keep call my phone I could hear the hu in their voice I pass out I do not know how long but when I look up I see the light on my husband truck and I drive to to a stop sign and he see I tear in his eye I know that I could not do that to my family no matter how I struggle I know that they need I and I need they just as much
I use mindfulness technique sorry for my english I m italian I use zenmeditation   defusion technique that be try to separate from thoght in many way you can say to yourself it be just a thought I do not have to do anything with it repeat the thought in different way slow very very slow fast very fast with other voice as imitate people until the thought become a thing as another insignificant thing you see on a table   if you sta breathe as you do in meditation or yoga than you can imagine to be on the grass look to the sky and every thought be a cloud and you put it on a cloud and you see it go away or always breathe imagine to be on a bridge and under you   you see some   train and those train have their wagon you put your thought on the train like this train of thought on the left train of emotion number   train of sensation about bodynumber and you note what be pass in your mind and you take the thought the emotiin or sensation and put it on the right wagon that be move under your bridge do not worry if you find on the train that be you believe your thought be so true and strong and you be rapt from it and you follow it without put an end as you   notice this thing you gentle say to yourself oh I be on the train oroh thank you miss mind or sir think to rimind I to exist but now I sta back breathe mindfully and come back on my bridge and you on your train and I say you goodbye I ts hard and it need a lot of practice but it work zen meditation help I a lot but I need to be follow by some people who practice it because alone it be hard with a mental illness
yes I actually attempt it I put a belt around my neck and just let myself choke I do it in the closet before I know it I be on a stretcher on my way to the hospital it be like be my girlfriend wake up to my cat meow at the door very loudly when she open it she say she grab my knife and cut I down I be out cold when I get to the hospital after a day or two they put I in the psych ward in there be where I learn how to cope and realize what my trigger be I have have some good thing happen since then but I still struggle with it daily stop take the med cuz I just do not believe in they but I just hold on to all the positive thing I have do and keep try to be more positive I recently make a movie so I do my good to keep my mind busy
I look at my child and my husband and everyone that care about I and think about how not have I in their life would affect their future sometimes find strength be hard but you have to push those thought aside they too shall pass they be temporary go for a walk or look into medical cannabis surround yourself with something you love   please tell someone you be feel this way call a hotline or tell your doctor there will be well day but please please tell someone if you be overwhelmed by these thought good luck to you you be woh it

yeah I be diagnose with everything I have at a very young age so maybe I just be not mature enough to receive that paicular diagnosis do bipolar disorder often get confuse with bpd they be pretty similar be not they I know a lot about bipolar which I have and a little bit about bpd but I have never compare the two
I have not actually but I have do some research on it and I agree but I be reluctant to say that to a doctor lol my mom a nurse and she tell I a long time ago that selfdiagnosing be the quick way to get laugh out of a doctor office I be not a hypochondriac though and I have be deal with unmedicated mental illness long enough to tell the difference between what be real and what be not I really think I could have bpd
I know from your first few line that it would be down to be tell you be not good enough when you be young be there myself I be glad you find your voice today and speak to we about how you feel that will empower you and make you feel strong I find my voice in my late teen and move away from the toxic people in my life   please find a good counsellor to talk through your self esteem and anxiety issue as they can help you   good luck xx
yeah my mom be a nurse and my dad be a very like very wellknown high school football coach and since I be the fuhest thing from a stereotypical coachs daughter a straighta student member of the student council etc I be basically the family embarrassment my parent care a lot about appearance and what other people think so heaven forbid if I ever open my mouth mine be rarely a popular opinion for example a girl be kill in a car accident at my high school jr year she be just one of many student who have die in less than a decade at that school student council her friend discuss the possibility of build a memorial for she on the school ground I be the only person who stand up and say that if they build a memorial for she they would have to build one for every student who have die at that school that it be not fair to commemorate the popular girl and just forget all the other like they do not matter boy do I hear it when my dad get home that afternoon he storm in the house put his finger in my face and tell I her friend can build a memorial for she if they want to and you well damn well keep your mouth shut about it I never understand that and I do not think I ever will if my daughter stand on her own and risk be hate by everyone she know do what she believe be right I would burst into flame I would be so proud
this be so need for student and parent the reason I say parent also be because my   year old daughter be diagnose with anxiety depression and and she be cut herself I find this out through the school consular thank heaven for she but one of my daughter   friend mother find out and her daughter be not allow to be friend with my daughter anymore this hu my daughter very much I think parent need to be educate about mental illness and realize that it be not contagious

they do not want to understand and could careless there be no compassion to the one that be suffer from it panic disorder with agoraphobia have what it seem like forever I be tell I fake it to get attention or med to feel good on so far from the truth

I be lucky I live in the youk   we have the nhs which we pay for through our taxis we do not have to pay to see doctor or for hospital treatment we do have a charge for prescription for people that work the unemployed and very low income earner get they free although we pay a fee it be still cheap than pay privately our government be plan on privatise our nhs so that will mean we will have to get health insurance and thing will probably be the same for we as yourself this really frighten I I bet the insurance for bipolar patient will be sky high I feel for you it must be terrible not to be able to afford the treatment you need I be so lucky at the moment hope you can get the help that you need soon we need our medication it make life almost bearable good luck redhea

I be just a little confused diagnose for   year graduate grade   be you a newborn when you be diagnose or do I misunderstand something
I have be properly diagnose and I choose not to be sick because I have allow myself to be for so long due to my own fear of self stigma   you can call it whatever you want to this be my journey and I choose to call it that while try to fight for my health and try to get well after after be rob so much by my illness I choose not to be sick because my bipolar be no long in control I be I choose it every fucking day to make my illness that much easy to fight be it make sure on a bad day I walk my dog to make sure I practice self care our illness and there journey be each different please do not judge my journey because yours be different for someone who have symptom   fucking year to not have any clearly all my work on my health be pay off I for once in my life have not have repeat thought of fucking kill myself because I be tired of feel sick one day   I could not go to school because my symptom be always on always make my life a mess when I change my own mind set to it be now I find what work for I

hey I be so sorry you be go through all that that sound hea wrench especially with the add stress of day to day life with both chronically ill and energetic child you sound very strong and like you lead with your strength I be sure your child admire the fierce example and light you give they and would undoubtedly miss you if you be to go you could visit your old and encourage he to have a meaningful life in or out of prison and try to survive together for a while   that be say your life be yours and you owe it to no one I hope that in lieu of mess you be take care of yourself in other way journale make time for walk I always love river walk the water flow make I feel like I can movebreathe when I be feeling drag under the whole dark times pass thing be bs but I find that if I tally up small moment of joy or feel awake during the day they help balance dark thought   to answer your question thought all the time I do think there be a difference between suicidal thought I can not do this I be not strong enough I want to just die and fade away my love one would be happy if I be dead and suicidal ideation here be how I will do it I will cancel this appointment to do it that morning sit about to then walk away then go back write letter with a time in mind specific I get more scared of the latter even if thought be common
no one text I   with my med I dream way more at night   I have no one to be awkward around when I isolate who care who get piss off   always wish I could fall asleep normal
by the way laugh away   I be very aware of depression and anxiety illness
I do not have a lot of money but what I do make sure to do be order my grocery online from shop rite when I be have a down week it be about   extra for they to shop and deliver it but it be woh it if otherwise you will not have food I would get cheap stuff like raman and cup of soup maybe try to get some protein shake because lack of protein can cause problem with serotonin I just read something about that the other day a good goal would be to try to go outside to get your mail every day just so you see the light of day or even just open a window it be impossible to think about but those thing might help
totally agree cause tension in the family strain in every relationship

I have be run pretty much ever since bipolar first staed to get ahold of I when I be   I go on long run about   mile I build myself up to that over time but it really help I it help I with that manic energy it give I   hour to also let my mind go and run through the restless thought afterwards the endorphin that we naturally produce from a good workout help I feel much well and accomplished running be originally my own form of self harm with the thought of if I collapse and die then that would be a way out and run to the point of exhaustion and muscle cramp but over time what be an unhealthy habit of self harm turn into a super positive daily routine of use that time and energy to focus my thought and emotion in a productive way to sta my day it keep I in good shape and have be a cornerstone of my mental health and overall well be the last   year I have also do thing such as rock climb hot yoga bike anything active that require you to be in tune with your whole body really really help I
I be so glad to read that you be able to get some help it be so hard for many of we to reach out and say we need help those who do not have bpd have a hard time understand how our brain be wire and how our perception can get in the way I be so grateful you be able to find a group that you could relate to and then individual that you could connect with we need those thing in our life   it help I so much to be able to talk to all of you here I be struggle right now and feel very much alone

I would say the cube would probably work well I have really bad social anxiety and the fidget spinner do not appeal to I at all would only bring more attention to myself aswell they seem more of a kid toy to I
also I do this last summer with my boyfriend son it be call time out bottle I call it a snow globe and do as an a project with he you mix water clear glue and sparkle in a water bottle and mix it up the idea be for they to shake it and watch it the sparkle settle while they sit in time out when it be down they be down and calm down it be really actually   calm I do one in one of those tinny airplane alcohol bottle to keep in my pocket book for those out in public break down
the people who really have an anxiety issue please do not use it   it will make you vacillate so after use this you be unable to focus on anything and feel like a crazy human    
not everyone it be the same I have anxiety and I have use it
help my hubby with anxiety want to see how he go with the cubr
I have the cube and I love it help with my social anxiety
my kid have one and they love iti have try it do not work for I I would like to try the cube its completly different for I my anxiety spike when I use a spinner   
same here I actually get very restless I guess it do not work for everyone
it help I with anxiety
I see where people be upset because the bushing may fall out when you put it in your mouth
ignorant people can sometimes be willfully ignorant please do not turn your back on your faith due to these people sin of unkindness find a church where you will be love for who you be flaw and all my depression and anxiety make it very difficult for I to walk a joyful triumphant christian life someday you will find a church like my family do where a woman who publicly share about her suicide attempt and subsequent hospitalization be now in a lay leadership role
I be a christian and yes I would be hu offend and very upset by someone say that to I run do not walk out of there it do not mean you have to give up your faith just that that paicular church be not for you I be so very sorry you have this happen to you and there be also no way to cleanse the mental illness out of your dna those people sound very uneducated and judgemental     
this be a poisonous and dangerous point of view and it do nothing but shame somebody who be bipolar well shame on anybody who have say that to you shame on they
holy crap marc I be shake
we really do struggle
I do everyday it be a struggle
amen I be one that struggle and battle that world I know though I have see people suffer tremendously bad than myself
I be an apostolic pentecostal and I recently go back to church unfounately I listen to several church that bring I to the altar three time try to throw the demon out of I while my three small child watch fearfully I be not possess it be not the devil I be a return christian and I will also tell you that I find my church by interview pastor first I find a great one who understand and do not do that you may have to seek out a different church pray about it and I will be pray with you in jesus name
it be totally disturbing
the devil have nothing to do with your biology and psychology this be the kind of abusive rhetoric that make people fear epileptic people and condemn they instead of helping stay away from that church they be not rational
that be horrible and rude of her
I be not a member of this group but see this post as a friend of mine be as a christian minister I would be embarrassed to hear any fellow church leader refer to any mental illness in such a way as a church we be not perfect but we try to suppo someone with any type of mental illness in the same way we would someone with a physical illness I be actually attend a seminar next week on pastoral care for people with mental illness as be equip to help people who be suffer be a key pa of what we be about I be sorry you be treat in such a way
it be why I belong to no organized religion when the church tell my father I be a whore for allow my uncle to get his kick out of bounce I on his lap I be maybe   and surely more so when I ask why be there blood in my underwear after a visit with my cousin age   or    so no people who believe this kind of vudoo thinking be only cling to irrational and harmful belief in my opinion it hold back our humanity
I be a christian I attend a pentecostal church for about   month the preacher wife who do most of the preaching on wednesday night for whatever reason say during a sermon pretty much that adhd and bipolar do not exist her nephew have be act up and be diagnose with adhd so I catch she after the sermon and ask she how she can say something like that when there be scientific brain scan that can be do to show the physical difference between someone with a normal brain as oppose to someone with bipolar I mean I get she not believe her nephew have adhd because he be only   or so but to blatantly say bipolar do not exist rub I the wrong way her response be they have have several people in the congregation that be bipolar and that through prayer they be heal I look at she and say well then they never have it to begin with and walk out I never go back   I know have be attend a different church for over a year and the pastor know I be bipolar and he know that there be science involve in order to keep I stabilize because my pastor be a rational thinking man he do not try to convince anyone with any disability that simply pray will make it go away he pray for and with we when we struggle but he understand it will not just go away
do not trust people in the church that be only a building an institution trust in the word I have the same dilemma but here it be   psalm   it be well to take refuge in the lord than to trust in man   the church be just a institution but the real church be believer in jesus     I know some people might not believe some here be atheist etc other might ask why the lord would curse they with a sickness I myself have struggle with this I suffer from bipolar too and have do some crazy thing during mania I do not believe in the church as an institution at all I do believe in jesus the only way human sickness be because the flesh be fleet it be manifestation of our sin it be flawed and degrading due to our sin since the exile from eden we be no long in his image   there be no cure for our ailment yet but keep faith it have help I in some dark time
I be attack by bipolarity ptsd and other psychology do not believe in demon possession but after   year of therapy and medication I finally try exorcism I feel the good I ever have I be still on three medication but I be down from six some mental illness be a chemical imbalance and other be clinical as you know I believe now that clinical mental illness be really demon possession and should be treat as such look at the man yell while walk down the street he be not just rambling there be a subject and a verb someone do something or do not god mabyand he relive this over and over he can not get past it mary the government husband etc etc these people be hue and you do not just tell hue people to get over it they be believe lie and need to hear the truth maby there should be some kind of combination treatment combine faith reason and a little medication until maximum improvement be achieve I be on lithium for   year and all it do be make I numb to life I could feel anger love fear or joy be that heal no
I think I agree with you carol mental illness require a holistic approach you need encouragement in term of biblical upliftment medication and therapy I believe its vital to anchor oneself especially as mental illness bring about anxiety selfdoubt etc etc also lot of selflove positivity and a cherished suppo system be necessary
there be some that feel prayer will cure cancer that scare I a little I liken it to you would not tell a diabetic not to take their med but you shun mental illness
I probably should ignore they but I do not   I flat out tell they they be wrong and that way of thinking be damage   and if they do not believe in doctor they should keep it to themselves   I always associate it to blood pressure pill and cancer treatment and tell they to go to those people as well with their pray it out
that be horrible I be sorry you go through that
yes I have be tell this before sadly by some of my own family they kind of get it now there be also an unspoken thing that other christians believe it be because of a lack of faith in god I have learn to try and avoid those people god have bring I some people who understand or at least try to understand I pray that god will send you someone like that as far as church right now I do not know I have not go in a while I be not exactly sure why paly sick of the masquerade pray about find another church that will welcome you with open arm if that be what you feel lead to do
  year ago I leave church protestant coz call I anormal the young brother and sister and make I cry always and I say I come from protestant baptist and I m not new protestant coz I raise n serve to god in my old other church before and they say how you know bible I say I study missionary and be leader before in my other church   but more be unkind to I this latin protestant church I get upset n decide to leave church and protestant n still my life outside but I still belief in god   coz I sta not go this chruch any say hello and all my life sta hard and mistake and get a very traumatic and bad experience I end with mental illne and eat disorder but I do not think I can go to church where I can be open and help I where be the love of god the preacher   when I try to be open in the other pastor about my trauma say forget and forgive to who hu you when you be kid and you sin will be forgive and maybe you play quija or have a satanic familiar and I say no I do not have that   I m good person and I be just a little   year old little kid be victim of something traumatic happen to I nothing to help nothing nice answer and nothing to heal say go to say sorry and forgive the person who hu you and you can be well and pray more and you need more commited to god  
I be catholic and I never hear such nonsense yeah you can pray for strength to fight your struggle but not to cure yourself or get over it wtfpeople should be help you grow in faith and suppo you thru hard time instead of demonize youfind a new church
narcissism be a personality disorder   the because be unknown but believe to be influence by parenting of a child with biological vulnerability   be it not chemical

I tell my good friend this via text that I could t handle call so please text or message I she then would text and as soon as I rely she would call needless to say we do t talk to each other anymore she could not respect I and my decision to not take call due to anxiety and she could not understand why I would not take her call except to be rude sad

this be what my friend once say he be first one to tell I about adhd talk about my anxiety nature   while take as a gift it feel well I also like that metaphor canary on the coal mine in any case there be uplift purpose why I be this way   woh keep go
please please do not give up   do not let this awful illness beat you   so many question which you do not have answer for   we need logic in our life to make any sense of the world and ourselves but mental illness do not often make logical sense eg we can often feel alone but push people away etc I guess I would need to ask lot of question to help you answer some of your but I think our mind be such a complex organ and just like other in our body it sometimes do not work as we want it to and sometimes it can not cope   at ceain time in our life some people need help   I be not sure whether you be receive or have have any suppo from family or professional or have help in the form of medication therapy etc    I remember at my low point I feel my head be constantly on fire it be exhaust no wonder you feel always tired and escape from our thought can feel so welcome impossible andor necessary you say you ve struggle for four year   that be one of the bad thing that it can go on for so long and feel as though it can take forever to get well I feel it be not live only exist not a life   why a   million dollar question   the answer probably due to hundred of small thing and quite possibly make bad by some notable big thing   I be sure study could have be really hard the discipline and energy need may well have take its toll but once it be over your life change possibly exciting in one way but scary in another as your secure your job I do not like to second guess as I do not know but just try to look at possible trigger and difficulty   begin a new stage of life must have be challenge why anyone have anxiety or depression at any point in their life if only we know but the impoant thing be how to get well from here plan be great goal be good but they can also seem insurmountable too big   on good day we might feel we can conquer the world and make wonderful plan on bad day get out of bed be a step too far   plan I think be definitely a good idea but they also need to include small achievable but significant goal   do your friend understand be they suppoive yes always anxious sound familiar when we struggle it can be one long round of constant anxiety as you be not well it make sense if you be not at peace with yourself or content    I believe we all ultimately want to get well to escape the quagmire of self pity and crap we be in but it be to find that way forward one step at a time do not lose sight of those plan but also it be necessary to be realistic and accept that it be not go to be easy   hold onto the hope that it can get well lean on those you love tell they how you feel and let they help you life can get well   take good care be kind to yourself you deserve a well life x
do not give upget a good psychologist and learn to manage the mood swing before be diagnose and get help I go thru a period of month realize I do not have to say more than   word a day only to find I could cut it down to six   be depress for day now but will struggle ondo not give up
I have to spiritually see the fact that god love we so much that we be never go to die   and fall to my knee in shame be completely embrace by mercy in order to not want to kill myself and that experience actually happen on the morning of the day I be plan on end this life forget the spacetime continuum we exist in the loveforgiveness continuum
everyday be a struggle try to keep your mind occupy hobby or a job with lot of ot that be how I get by
hey I be so sorry to read you be not feel well my first thought be be you or have you in the past   yrs receive any treatment or medication for your anxiety   I be guess depression have you speak to anyone include a dr about how you be feel right now if not can you do that before you reso to self harm I know it be hard I have live with a variety of mood disorder since my early teen so appreciate how you be feel I encourage you to take the first step    find someone you trust that you can share your struggle with blessing  
shakir

yeah I feel that way    confusing and then disappoint and then depressionmanialol I only laugh because what else can I do everyday I try to be normal functioning
I think for I when I finally get my dx it take long because I be flighty I would quit before they could tell I what be wrong because I do not want to hear it and well mental illness do not exactly make consistency easy but I stick with it a few year ago I have get out of a horrible abusive marriage I have   boy count on I and I just know I do not want to be I anymore whatever that be or have be it be take a long time to get to where I be and I be still a long way to where I need to go but I be fuher than I have ever be I do not regret wait because everything happen for a reason and for whatever reason I be not ready and live in whatif will drive I madder if I know I be so screw up in the head I would have never have kid I would have never live any of the experience I have the thought of not have my boy be beyond comprehension they be my salvation at time they be the one thing I have get right in life they be what give I the strength to get out of an abusive marriage without they I would not be here so an early dx would have prevent they from be bear
in   a dr prescribe those to I and although I already shake because of my anxiety those make my shake bad it be embarrassing I see a psychiatrist a few month later and he tell I that the dr should not have precribe I those two together he put I on effexor klonopin and trazadone and my shake almost stop good luck hope you can find something well
wellbrutin make I shake I be on zoloft clonazepam doxipen remeron lamictal and ambian as need for insomnia take I   year to get right I be get mine upped since   I be tip a little up the lamictal be at the low dose need more
I use to take wellbutrin and would shake
do not b ashamed of you be illness
tell these people they have no clue what they be say or talk about and that bipolar be a far more serious issue then even ju an array of emotion at one time do you know that bipolar also cause serious physical health problem ask they if they know that tell they they need to be more educate on sumthin before they go shoot off at the mouth and you do not need to tell they it be you that suffer tell they you know many close people that do not that you should be ashamed at all that be like be ashamed that you have a limp or other defect from bih you can not help how you be bear I wear my bipolar proudly I be exactly how god make I
I think this be a great question I always call people out on that but I do it discreetly so they do not feel embarrassed plus they usually listen if they do not feel threaten I say something like I know you mean no harm by that but please take a moment to consider your listener maybe they have a love one with bp and use mental illness as a joke only perpetuate their feeling of isolation be kind to they and respectful and you would be surprise how many positive response you will get     good luck
I know it upset I so much it be very irritating but I have to calm myself down and educate they not that they ever care because they will tell I it be a joke then I educate they some more it hu yes but there be still a lot of stigma on mental illness it will take a while to change the world but you can educate one person at a time
my daughter and I be bipolar we make statement like this often to each other only when we be in private amongst each other it be our way of try to find humor in such a horrible illness give we a reason to laugh and understand at the same time we suffer sever depression with ours and the mood swing so when we can laugh its great
do not be ashamed you have do nothing wrong nothing to be ashamed about we just be who we be   as for they there be no educate the ignorant just keep step do you  
hii be not bipolar I have suffer from anxiety depression and ptsd   soooo I be with you would these same people use the word retardedmaybe ask themwe know it be not correct to say that some people need to be aleed to other feeling
do not feel shame that only allow the illness to win if it bug you say something

yep and I truly do not care right now I will be   in a few week never marry no kid but I have decide to only focus on I and have a baby myself thru an iui with an a anonymous sperm donor I be not give up on become a mom due to not be able to find a good man I feel that my bipolar be not to blame the only way in which I can remotely see its role be that I be very all or nothing and also I trust nobody and will go to great length to make sure my man be not lie or cheat on I so I can become obsessed with that and be an amazing natural at play detective I have have ton of past serious relationship but sure enough my instinct be always right on and I would catch they in huge lie all the time and some cheating
I feel the same way I just staed see someone n really fkin afraid that my anxiety n depression would scare she away
I feel the same way I have a big paranoia that past relationship be well than have I and easy and happy than be with I I feel too crazy I feel mean at time when I snap but can not change it and I always think there be someone else it suck and the hard thing be try to figure out if it be our head think up crap again or if it really be how you be think it be however in say all that I be a strong believer that there be someone for everyone to love
yes   this thought be a major player in my depression I would love to be in a relationship have kid etc the whole deal I be   and can not shake the feeling it be never go to happen now even though I want it to more than anything in the world it suck
there be hope I have bipolar borderline personality and anxiety as well as thyroid disease and hypoglycemia and I have be in a relationship   year now never split up believe I I be a roller coaster to live with and he be a saint for deal with it but we stay together and we have both only kiss another person once and we talk it over and neither of we have be unfaithful since
same I always feel staff do not like I paranoid but I can not help it I be go for my second attempt at cbt redhea
I have be in a relationship for   year with my bp boyfriend and I can tell you it have not be an easy road honesty trust and most of all communication be essential as well as an understanding of his illness through read post like these he have his own room therefore his own space for whenever he need it and I respect his need for it I be slowly develop a thick skin for his huful word and action when he s manic because I see the great person he truly be beneath his fear phobia and anxiety and try to reassure he and help keep he ground so far so good do not give up on love the right one be out there wait for you xxxx
I have be marry for   and a half year and we have be together a total of year and know each other   year my mother and aunt whom both have vary severity of bp and anxiety plus eating disorder have be marry over   year just need to find the one whom can deal with   help you through the crazy
I be glad I have the oppounity to have be in a   year marriage I just wish he would be strong enough to have stand by I to find out what be wrong with I I be diagnose during the divorce but symptom be there for many year now I be afraid noone will want to deal with my issue not that anyone be even look to get to know I without know about they so I figure I will grow old and die alone
I have be with my boyfriend for almost a year before this relationship I do not think I would ever be in one   I do not even want to be in one from the very beginning of our relationship we be both   honest with each other he know about all my struggle and I make sure he understand that our relationship will not be easy it take a lot of communication especially right now because we be long distance I think communication and honesty from the get go be key
yes the sad pa be that while thing be good I fall in love with my now husband I be not do well anymore and the poor guy be stick with I I can not stand to be around I and he try really hard to understand my mood swing and need to be leave alone but unless you have be be we go mentally you can not understand I feel so bad for he he never would cheat do not mean I do not worry that he should find someone that could give he what I can not he deserve to be happy you know and I can not be that

thomas riske
I have get epilepsy and anxiety but some people only understand the epilepsy and not both together and the damage it can cause
I have be reject by so many people at so many time that I profoundly believe that I be unlovable I be terrify of the future because of my past everyday be a new day but when most of the past day have be shit it be very difficult to accept that the come day will be well I have not give up yet and still struggle everyday hope against the hope that some miracle will change the world
many time in my life I be a   go getter   I go to college early away from home adjust and adapt and join the friend and crowd   I have be engage to   different decent man and I have never have any child   I become a nurse at   and I have be marry   help raise my ex husband kid who grow up wonderful I divorce my husband after five year and move back into my parent home    in   year of nursing I have work at four place and agency and I try to stay at the same place as long as I can   I be comfoable where I be work and who I be today at    I be not afraid of failure anymore atleast not as much as I use to be and daily I do my good to stay on the right track and achieve however contrary to popular belief I like to be alone and not visit unless I be very comfoable around someone and that be the problem perhaps   I lie the card out right away because I figure people will know I truly that way   I have always be   ok bla bla this be I about question   I can not explain my anxiety   but when I be in work mode it be fight or flight and I be a leader to the good of my ability   my large fear be make a mistake and we all make mistake    my large fear be stay alone even though I need that time to heal   ty
I be sometimes afraid of live and that terrify I I have cry immediately after wake up simply because I be still alive I actually have people who love I a wife etc and none of it be good enough to change my illness
this be not unique to any kind of mental illness and the suggestion that it be could be quite damaging to anyone read it this be a great page by and large but I do wonder if some member ability to so the wheat from the chaff be somewhat lacking at times fear of the unknown be perfectly normal but obsess over thing which might not come to pass might not be
you look and you search for as long as it take however horrible the journey and whatever you lose along the way it be imperative to your life that you undeake this mission kill yourself do not transcend pain in any way it mean cause only more of it take a step towards people and they will take two towards you those who do not be never woh your time or your hea in the first place and they will be the most surprising people in your life after total honesty and disclosure only then do you know what your really have to work with in your life to carry on with
by submit themselves to the big unknown to humankind I try to kill myself last year but I live because I can still feed my baby daughter breakfast every morning I be very glad that I do not die of course in desperation our reason and logic and our vision can all abandon we but believe I and take this from a person who know it can get well and you can take control you have to find your strength which mean you look in the first place you last have it inside of yourself
my personal belief be that due to the fear of the unknown   people take their own life to feel in control
I be afraid of die the fear of the unknown when I will die or what happen when I do keep I up at night often
I have bipolar   and I do not feel a big change until I stae take lithium I still take about   or   different medicine in addition to that and they all work together to give I the good result possible I do get lithium poisoning once which be horrible but the doctor just lower my dosage and I be fine I go for blood test every few month to check lithium level I really stae feeling like a person once I stae the lithium
night terror can be bring on by ceain medication I get they sometimes and need to take a diazapam with my sleep pillmood stabilizer
hi liz   I so hear you about be tired of go back and foh to the doc and play the trail and error game   as hard as it may be to play that game unfounately it be about the only way they can find the right combination for you and your body type   each one of we be different in how our body will react so it be hard to say what will work for you   it can take a long time to find the right combination but it be not just about the med   please as anne state work at find a team that can help you   this include a psychiatrist your family doc and a therapist and other suppos as well   you talk about the nightmare and night tremor   this be something that you can work with a train prefessional on with cbt or other form of therapy that work for you again sometimes trail and error but woh it   in my opinion and experience it be only when I have a therapist that I trust and could really open up to and be able to talk about the reason for my ptsd that I be able to slowly get the nightmare terror and body memory to get less frequent   hang in there and continue to work with your team to find the good treatment for you
hi guillermo I have bpd and bipolar   with anxiety and ptsd I be founate in find a therapist on the referal of a thrapist I know socially but I think a google seach may be in order for you google bpd and it may bring up a sub search of therapist in your area
wow do I understand this I know what it be like to be bipolar with manic depression and anger issue that be wrong for he to push you to get to that point after two year he should know that stop mean stop not just for your health but because it be not good on either one of you for you to get that upset I know when I be angry I do not always think through what I be say   and have be know to say thing that hu   not mean too I be just go to throw this out there if you ever need anyone to talk to message I I will gladly be the ear that you need with nobody else will
how I feel most day and its like a daily struggle to just get up and get go but I can not seem to get anyone to understand
my sweet baby girl miss almost a year at   and now we homeschool so all the pressure be lift
in the last   year I have have two therapist that I feel close to connect with and trust   they save I more than once from self harm or bad   it help to be able to talk to they   I no long have they and I can definitely relate to be disconnect and feel isolated   it be a horrible feeling that no one would ever understand unless they have experience it   I now realize after all of these year that I will just have to except that I be alone in this respect and continue to be thankful for the blessing I do have
confuse
for about a month now my anxiety have be through the roof and I be so stuck in between these two I know I will have to work extra hard to get out of this anxiety because I want to live more than anything I have so much to live for this may be hard but the fight be woh it
just afraid to live
I be not afraid to die in fact I   wish for it every day
I be not afraid to die I be afraid of leave my   baby behind
horrible existence be not it I be there for decade
that be I not that I be anti social I be polite and friendly to everyone just shy and anxious so I withdraw and people think I be different
nah it be just anxiety
or people because anxiety and a low selfesteem   even my close friend do not invite I over
sorry its so long but hope it help med be a struggle
first stop be ashamed would you feel shame if you have cancer when people say something like that just know they be say the weather be have mood swing wet dry cold hotit be not actually direct or mean as anything I have live with this for   year and I have learn it be pa of who I be and I feel no shame but not from lack of try to shame I from my mom it be just who I be and I have enough trigger without let ignorance of someone else be another next time someone say something be bipolar respond with poor weather poor wash machine you have no idea what they be go through and laugh it off do not be ashamed of the illness it make we very special we be talente aistic and all around extremely intelligent people that be nothing to be ashamed of
thank you to everyone who have respond my mother advice be to take the high road and not let it affect my day easy say than do   I would love to educate those who use the term so lightly but speak up be something I have never be good at I have only open up to a few people about be diagnose with bipolar and bpd I have alienate every friend I have ever make because I could not handle the pressure of friendship so now I have make a friend and she use the term bipolar for anything from her hair to the weather I try to laugh it off as ignorance but deep down it make I feel imperfect and different from regular people I take mood stabilizer s and use cannabis for anxiety but still have those underlying symptom to struggle with I have family that love I but they will never understand the battle I be fight with myself I guess I will have to learn how to love myself before I try to make friend and learn to let the little thing go   I be thankful that I be not the only one feeling this way but it be a rotten feeling to feel ashamed to be I keep on keep on much love from colorado
we have borrow the term from the english language to fit the disorder not the other way around I be an electrician and polar and bipolar be generic term we use when I be diagnose with bipolar disorder I understand it very clearly because I connect it with the electrical term I would not get upset because when people be say it they most likely be not compare it in their head with bipolar disorder one or   they most likely have a different picture in their head altogether then you be imagine I hope this help
the thing that get I upset be that the one who say it be usually the one that put up the mental illness suppo meme on their facebook page

what you describe be what I suffer with on a daily basis   ib have rapid bipolar   severe anxiety bpd and ptsdall of which can be life threaten do not stop til you find someone that will listen to you sometimes you have to go a little bat shit crazy for they to realize the severity   of it that be what I have to do let your raw emotion out on they ib know that be a very vulnerable feeling to have to do but sometimes it be necessary for they to see that something really need to be dive to help you

hi fellow canadian here have you try look at program available in your area for people with your illness   I have find we have to be the people who fight for our own health I have to go to a womans clinic and walk in doctor for a year try to stabilize my bipolar because my doctor get very ill and when I get sick she have just get sick as well so I have have to really learn to navigate the system myself it be not ideal but I be sure that there be a doctor who can and will listen to you and help you get well also have a full blood screen do you may have a under lie health condition that need proper treatment as they can also effect how your mind feel also if you have bipolar you be take effexor for depression be not ideal as it can cause mania and that just make the low bad I find something to treat the anxiety be well at least that be what my doctor explain to mei be on previous to treat low and it make I bad
another canadian here I find there be resource out there that be not use because no one refer to they check to see if you have a mental health and addiction intake centre or a mental health resource clinic in your area   do not be afraid to advocate with your doctor either
my daughter be go through the same thing it be so hard to watch we recently have a genetic test do google genesight testing that test her dna with over   psychiatric medication include antidepressant mood stabilizer    and anxiolytic it turn out that most of the med she have be on be not able to be metabolize by her body so the med never work they give we a repo on the med that will work and now she have hope again it might be woh a try I think of all the year and money spend on medication that never work and all the time she be endure the depression and anxiety wait the   to   week for the med to work and they never do I be sorry you be in this dark place too right now I hope thing sta to get well for you and think this might be a suggestion for you to think about good luck

I stop take medication I learn that you control you be own feeling you want to be sad so be it if you want to be happy then be happy stop dwell on the past it be behind and do with focus on today and look forward to tomorrow all these medication be kill you slowly anyways hell if you read the side effect to all of they you will notice   of these thing say cause depression so you be depressed and your go to take a pill that have a side effect of depression you be go to let some little pill control your life   it take I   year to get off seroquel due to the withdrawal I have I be dependint on some little pill to make I happy and sleepy   now I be off it feel amazing and lose weight damn thing turn I into a over sized watermelon   now I know not everyone be the same blah blah blah bullshit   do not make an excuse if I can find happiness than so can you   if you realllllllly need to take something for you be aneixty then smoke a little weed if it be illegal in you be state or country who care get that shit it be hell of a lot healthy then those pill   mind you this be my opinion so do not get all you be pantie tie up in a bunch and attack I
I have be on almost every drug there be since I be diagnose in   I feel hopeless in find something tht would work   but ten year ago I be prescribe seroquel and citalopram and to be honest with you I would recommend it to anyone I do not want people to go through wat I go through so plz give it a try tell you be doctor to sta you off on   mg of seroquel and   mg of citalopram than progressively move up   I have anxiety at night so I take both of these at night and I wake up fully refresh dnt be discourage if you get real sleepy with they at first it take a little while for your body to adjust to they
you might have to sta on a small dose of seroquel the low dose be   I only take a small dose but it be helpful along with my other medication which include prozac for depression anxiety and ocd and a good amount of mood stabilizer for my bipolar disorder
I just stae it recently do a great job as a mood stabilizer but afraid of weight gain
feel like you be bring everyone and everything down regardless of thwir assurance that its not the case   put life on pause to find the right med combo and feel guilty for that on top of it
it be the med well know as they because uncontrollable eating apparently they trick the brain into think you have not eat
thank you so much for your reply   luckily I have a friend that will be take I to and from the gym as my anxiety be to high on bus   or I get easily irritated with people   well do you for what you have accomplish that be a lot of strength and commitment I be just come out of a bad patch so need to get active again   I be not sure I could go veggie lol like meat to much   thank for your reply

I have borderline personality disorder and bipolar I as borderline we wear our emotion or hea on our sleeve we protect those who we dearly love and if you make we upset you will know it quickly I have severe trust issue if that tell you anything I do not take criticism very well either bpd be cause by a traumatic event at some point in our early life you have to be a strong enough person to handle someone with bpd we can be quite emotional borderline just mean we feel anger hu depression x bad than the normal individual we can say thing that we do not mean if we be upset and those thing can be pretty cruel at time this be the I hate you but do not leave I mental health issue I be just be   honest here if you can find a way to calmly talk to we then a bpd relationship be for you if you get upset easily nah it will not work my husband have be with I for almost   year now it can be do if you communicate effectively we can be quite possessive of the people we love and when you have do something wrong we have no problem cut you out permanently we be epic at silent treatment it be like we need to protect ourselves from feel that pain from that traumatic event again if we sense there be anything amiss we be out of there psst but we love sex at least some of we really do  
I be on board with honesty and trustwithout which I do not think you have any chance of make it work I have bpd and bipolar tendency whatever the he will that be lol my paner of almost   year have bipolar disorder we tattoo trust on ourselves in someplace we see at the beginning to make sure we never forget our commitment to make it the foundation of our relationship then we spend the next ish year be completely honest with one another we might not always like what each of we have to say but the honesty helps keep thing transparent these disorder will complicate your life enoughdo not add anything else in the mix that would confuse or complicate the relationship that be say you can understand the demon each other face well than a healthy person you can sympathize with the issue your paner face you will be proud of their success because you will know what it cost the only thing sometimes you will have to put a disagreement or discussion off till later because when the disorder be run the show you can not have a rationale conversation you have to wait till your paner be back in charge to have some talk I would not want to live without my bipolar paner I be grateful every day we be willing to take a chance on we love always   sparklesredheasparkle   sparklesredheasparkle

it be not I but a family member   that have this struggle   it break my hea for I want to make it all well but have to accept that all I can do at this point be love and pray
I have bipolar   and anxiety I be first diagnose at   and be now   one thing I have learn be that medication be necessary in ny life you have to coime to term with your illness
I completely understand how you feel it be a struggle to accept that you have no control over your own feeling I have have many similiar experience it be huful not be accept because of it I have learn to not be ashamed that I have these illness but I still try to protect myself from shallow people
hi rachel how be youi be struggle with the term that I have an illness as a matter of fact I hate the stereotypea soon as the subject come up people do not want anything to do with ya   
I also have bipolar   with major depression anxiety and ptsd been battle it a long time I agree that the good thing be to just roll with it but that do not mean do nothing with a suppoive doctor the right therapist and right medication life can be manage quite well that do not mean perfect there will be down time but with the right therapy these can be manage well just remember to ask for help when you need it definitely baby step I wish you all the very good
I usestill do fearworry about that alotto be honest I have learn to try my good everyday no matter what I be just go to keep fighting everyday be a strong person and there be always other around I to keep a smile on my face and I realise also there be always someone look out for methank goodness
it have already have   my marriage end I lose my career and I be so scared so depressed and have so much anxiety and panic that thing will never be the same and I feel hopeless
I have bad depression and anxiety I have be very depressed at time that I sta think that sometimes be go out of this world would be well but then I think of my family and the true friend that I have now and I feel well be on med do not work though but I fight and keep fight to get well I pray that someday I will get well I will not give up
I worry about this every second I wonder who I could be miss who I be I have lose my chance at a career because of this depression and anxiety   
no doubt this have happen to I
for I right now it be like I be have a dream after so many year of my life wake up every day to nightmare   there be hope I be live proof I have my life back after be diagnose with bipolar anxiety and ptsd   year ago I try to enjoy my life everyday while I have be stable these past   year and not take my life for grant I now work as peer suppo specialist at king view for the oakwellness center and use my life journey with mental illness to inspire mentor and empower other and let they know there be hope we be so much strong than we think
my gp seem really hesitant to refer to I a psyche I do not know why   I have ask about it before
I be diagnose bipolar   and yeah that seem pretty consistent with my day keep a journal try to keep detail such as how long you be feel a ceain way how those feeling be and thing you do much like this post the daysweek I consider my up day symptom of mania show I try to channel that energy into positive thing go on a run get school work do yard work chore piano etc and day that I be down I just acknowledge that I be ok it be just the disorder mess with I and mentally get myself encourage enough to go for my run even if it turn into more of a walk or a sho jog normally at least get move and outside kicksta my day really well and get I over that depression hump but most impoantly keep in contact with your doctor the reason bipolar be so dangerous be the mixed episode that can begin to occur where you have thoughtsfeeling of depression and anxiety but the energydrive of a manic episode which turn into a combination that lead to self harm for that reason it be super impoant to try and stay a step ahead of the disorder and work with your doc to stay as clear head as possible during my stay in a psych hospital and therapy learn as much as I could about cognitive behavioral therapy have help I every single day and help I be much more independent
thank you   I do not want anyone to diagnose I I be just freak out a bit last night because I go from super high to super low and I be terrify of the doctor so I do not want to go there and make a fool of myself if it be nothing     my gp be try to sway I away from see a psyche I do not know why   maybe I be that crazy and she know I will be section or something if I see one     lol

regardless of whether a side effect be normal or not unless your doctor tell you it would happen and do not worry about it you should call himher and let they know they can not help you if they do not know what be happen especially true when try to find the right med make sure you let they know you be still take your med but you want they to know how you be react to they
I take mgs of cymbalta a day also valproate yes l do get a few tremor but l think it be quite normal after year of mis   diagnosis and and a very miserable life a few tremor be nothing your gp should be able to find the right combination for you good luck
that be normal with many psych med usually it will subside within a month bad case scenario it may take   month   if they do not subside within   month please tell your doctor what be happen I have have medication where I staed have involuntary facial movement if this occur on any medication you want to tell your dr right away this could become permanent if the drug be not discontinue its not as scary as it sound but that be one side effect you need to be sure to tell your dr about good luck to you

bipolar can be extremely happy without worry about be manic I can if you be lopsided on your med and incline to the depressive you need an adjustment from say anti depressant to mood stabilizer but I can assure you it be very easy to be happy and positive with bipolar

perspective opium be all natural many drug be obtain from plant all natural be not well or bad than drug that be manufacture in a lab and unfounately it sometimes mean unknown and change concentration of the active ingredient which can lead to overdose it can also mean make in someone be kitchen and contaminate because they be distract which can make you sick or bad and ceain all natural remedy can interact badly with some medication st johns will should never be take with antidepressant that be selective serotonin or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor the interaction can be very bad if you want to add a natural remedy it be also a drug and you should talk to your doctor before take it   well safe than sick or bad
I have be talk to my therapost which be a military ptsd specialist   he be not a fan of scrip drug and say the side effect be very dangerous he believe exercise like hike good diet talk and cbd oil be a good combo to sta with I as well uave be on benzo and they be highly addict   I thoght I wa go to die get off of zanax quiet calm be my key when I be gong to loud situation I hike before hand to make sure I be be ground I think the good thing be to avoid thing that be difficult until you have the confidence to deal your body and mind have alarm system tell you if your taking or do something wrong listen to it
I be prescribe xanax when I first stae take benzo the dr tell I to take one   time a day I be in college at the time I could not remember shit so I learn to only take they when I be have a panic attack or go into a situation I know will cause an anxiety attack when take benzo this way the medication do not make you feel drowsy   forget thing if you only take it as need it simply calm you down   stop anxiety attack be careful with benzo they be addictive   you will build up a tolerance if you take it when you do not need it with that say some people need they I recommend not take they as instruct that be usually why people get into trouble with they they build up a tolerance then you have nothing to combat your bad anxiety to lessen my dependant on xanax when I feel anxious I take a product sell by thorne research its call pharma gaba   for panic attack take your benzo med I also take the pharma gaba   for sleep they use to have to give I heavy sedative for I to sleep this product work well   you do not feel weirdhungover the next morning gaba   also be not habit formingaddictive I also recommend cannabis oil most people be not aware that it be legal for anyone to buy cannabis oil as long as it do not contain thc cbd oil can be purchase online and deliver to your door check out charlottes web there be many other place to purchase it as well

mine actually tell I to for once finish what I staed about four month after I try to commit suicide they be horrible people leave he before it get bad because it always will
that be an unbelievably horrible thing to say to someone who be not well and cruel I might call it abusive you need somebody who be go to treasure you and help you not try to push you over the edge what be it control it be very very toxic and you need to keep yourself safe
horrible man you deserve way well than that do not listen to that man
I tell an abusive paner who use suicide as a threat to manipulate I I once tell he if he do it would not be my fault take out of context those be unbelievably horrible word to say to someone who be just say they be suicidal so I understand this person just want more context may not change the outcome obviously that be a bad relationship for the both of we
I may be able to help you two out as I see kayla point and actually agree but I see kimberly dislike your comment while yes it be a medical term and here it be be use in a proper connotation   be it controversial kim I believe you be upset because they do not say intellectual disability correct I may be off base so sorry to assume I be just try to be a friendly gap bridger both be correct but I know   intellectual disability be more pc and the more current term however before I d the term mental retardation be use as a correct description of intellectual and mental deficit   so yes in a medical suppo poster although the term be a little outdated it be still not make to belittle or mock I d just a old term for the same thing medicine be always evolve and so be we this be make to suppo and bring attention to many cause not bring down one I also would like to note that I believe whoever make this poster may not be in a medical field or have a strong medical background because narcolepsy be list I have narcolepsy but that be not a mental disorder it be neurological so perhaps the person responsible mean well just be not fully inform I believe they really do mean to be suppoive but just do not know well to use the term i d
when I first staed it I have a similar reaction as well as get an upset stomach I stae take it before I go to bed instead of in the morning which help heap and it settle down after a couple of week be the good medication for I out of all the one I have try
there be no doubt from your word you be pretty desperate and struggle to cope   I guess many question come to mind such as do you have parent be they aware of your mental health problem if they do be they suppoive also do you have a good doctor I guess you may be in the us while I be in the uk where doctor be readily and freely available and you can change around until you find the good for you when I be really in a bad way unfounately I be way old but there be still similarity plus my teenage son have have acute anxiety and depression my brother too when I be ill I be adamant I would not take sleeping tablet see a counsellor or go onto anti depressant medication I would not even admit to sta with that I have depression until I end up on the edge of a breakdown and know for my sake as well as my family something have to change I have have a lot of problem with staff at my son high school push he and have an email recently add more pressure say he be go to fail his exam and would not be able to continue next year this approach be not help apply more pressure on he when he be already not cope and make he feel a failure   some of the thing he be tell I how he feel over the year be heabreake thing you never want to hear as a mother but I be so relieved though he can tell I and I want to know how he feel so I can help accordingly    I have explain to he it be not about fail or succeed if his exam result be not great then I d like he to be able to think he have not achieve quite as well as he would hope but that be not a problem it be not insurmountable and really it do not matter   there be so much pressure here and probably similar there on our young people to succeed in their study it be far too much pressure on their young shoulder as a society we need to back off gently encourage and be kind I be sure this would be far more affective than frightening and bully they mental illness be not be stupid weak or a failure   our brain be the most complex organ like other pas of our body sometimes they do not work so well   we all need a help hand from time to time and until the world take mental illness seriously and stop be unkind impatient and not understand then thousand and thousand of people suffer in relative silence it be all wrong   reach out hun tell those who love you how you really feel   if they truly love you they will understand it be not for you to make they they have the responsibility to understand and to help look again at small but significant step to make you well   do you need something to help your bad period be they cause deficiency in your body medication can be a temporary crutch to help you get back on track during a paicularly busy time    can you talk to your lecturer jot down some note so you do not forget I be sure your mind might be completely jumble   how can you study effectively when you feel like this   I be not tell you what to do just look at option   suppo be one of the most impoant thing along with consideration and kindness    you need people to give you a break but if they be not aware of the full fact then they might not be able to help properly do not push love one away with depression we can feel so alone but we also try to isolate ourselves too think of you and hold on to hope that it will get well there be always hope look after yourself x
tell they do not be ashamed
mine be also the bad then its be my experience that professor in the field of education be very accomodating to disability whether physical academic or mental health relate   you be not weak or fragile you be suffer from a disease that inhibit your day to day life talk to they

sometimes the brain be just uncontrollable
I believe in god   I pray for help and to be heal   god make I this way   it be a daily struggle    believe in a high power will not cure this disease
please remove this ridiculous and damaging post immediately shame on you
no cure anxiety be not as easy as just turn to god by that logic just turn to god should cure a person of cancer or save they from die of a fatal disease just like that   and I be pretty sure a lot of people with bipolar depression and anxiety who follow god be actually decent christians yet they still have those condition this post be as bad as just think positive or just relax
very inappropriate I be disappoint even if you be a person of faith god be not the answer for a person with a biological illness shame on you

I be only   year old I have already be on lot on medication that have not help and have counselling which help for about   minute but now it be bad I never want to go out because of my depression and anxiety I have to be make to go out otherwise I just would not I work   day a week which be hard for I some day every day I have at least one person say to I why do you look so miserable all of time or pick your face up off the ground or snap out of it which make I feel bad because it do not matter how many time you tell they people you can not help it they still make you feel crap and just do not understand people who do not suffer with depression honestly do not get it and it be very frustrating I be not live anymore I be just exsiste additional comment from the original poster
it be so hard when you feel as bad as you do   severe depression be all encompass   it define you and take over your whole life   everyday be pretty much the same in term of desperation sorrow and try to battle the demon in your head when   you be least able I remember all too clearly day after day week after week be sofa bind will the endless day to end have no strength or drive to be able to change thing or get well   the trouble be recover from severe depression involve so many thing and all of which involve strategy which seem almost alien and impossible to implement it can seem such a monumental task and when the task seem so huge I think it be almost impossible to believe you can ever make it happen do not give up on that hope   when there be hope there be a chance   I know it can seem so far away or so difficult to find that contentment or inner peace we all crave but you can do it   you ve come this far you must congratulate yourself for do so well to get this far when your mind be lead you astray whilst I be waste my life and just exist not live I want escape constantly not want this life but because I live through the carnage of my close friend and relative suicide I know that just be not the answer   I want escape but not that   I know there have to be another way there be so many question I would need to ask about your suppo if you have any medication if you have access to professional service I be in the uk and I suspect you be in the us and service might not be available or affordable   I be no expe just someone who care and understand able mental illness and the hideous affect it can have and the intolerance and ignorance which exist in the world    I finally reach the realisation that no one else would get I off that sofa only I I have to find the determination and strength to do it I owe it to myself    I come up with a plan I be not go to waste any more life   a goal for the future some big thing eg find some meaningful voluntary work some small eg sit in the sunshine   many thing be involve from sleep tablet to give I a welcome respite to get counselling so many thing contribute and be necessary from try to eat well to reach out to love one admit I need they I be not pretend it be quick and I be still on the path but I be now work and have a completely different life I call it my new life after depression   big step be not necessary because they be unachievable small achievable but significant step be the one that can work tiny goal but step forward not back do not try to run before you can walk   my aim be to write a book one day but for now I be happy to enjoy the little pleasure in life confirmation I have make it through and there be no go back   good wish thought and hope to you there be a well way xx
to this I would say you do not want it to all be over if you do this would not have got write it be hard be in a dark place even more so when you can see yourself push love one away because your already scared they will leave you and push they away just heighten that feeling and then that make you bad first you need to find a smile not a fake one for any mean necessarya tv show a child innocent smile once you have that slight brake thru now you need to grab hold of that and look deep find out what be make you angry more than not be aim at yourself and work with it it be only way I get thru they and when I get angry I like it I feed on it but I get a moment of clarity and that be what I grab hold of do not think about give up that will not make you well that make all your love one bad and possibly on the road that your on now
lonely serenity peace turmoil
I have that with jess now my stress be throw the roof
first off your illness have nothing to do with what you do    year old know right from wrong no amount of rumor make you do it either blame your illness be wrong because you do have conscious smh secondly what be do be do the past be the past for a reason as far as want forgiveness ruin a teacher welfare and reputation probably be not go to be fix with I be sorry so you be illno pass sorry you know what you be do you even say you feel guilt   you just need to live with it and move on
I will tell you what I would do   write he a letter explain the truth   it be eat you alive and you need to apologize to move past it   give it to the headmaster and make peace with the fact it be pa of the past and think of it like this    it can rest on he   if he want to hate you   give he that option but it put it on he and release the guilt for you   once you know you do the right thing by let he know how you feel about it as in it bother you to the point of interfere with your life you should feel well because you have do everything in your power to show he you acknowledge the damage you cause   he might hate you but it be get to feel rewarding to know it hus you    if that be true if not he will forgive you   either way forgive yourself   you know your sorry
reach out to bipolar suppo group and mental health education outreach program and try to find a way to have professional go to school and educate adolescent who be vulnerable and susceptible to mental illness you can help prevent this from happen again sometimes it be good to leave the past alone so you do not drag up old feeling and just try to pay it forward
focus on right your wrong through future action make sure you talk to preteen about bully etc do not feel so eternity guilty its do and over with as an adult go speak to the headmaster have a meeting with the teacher and the headmaster if explain your action will calm your guilt if they will not hear you write a letter
shame someone be never useful she be try to dig herself out of shame unless you be without flaw I would suggest some kindness
ummm I be sorry bad mouthing she do not ruin her life it may have make it suck quite a bit   he on the other hand could have get jail timelost his job lose friend and family the list go on and on his life would have be ruin I agree the whole situation in general suck and she be by all account still a child and mentally ill at that but do not compare the two I have be bully and have rumor about I in school   it be nothing compare to what he would have deal with also   wrong do not make a right oh he say something bad so I can retaliate no   it sound like she be well and everyone have move on except her sense of guilt   I say to just let it go   if there be no permanent damage you should seek counseling to help you move past   I be sorry all this happen but as long as you hold yourself accountable and move past it you will hopefully be okay
what about the teacher bad mouthing first he destroy this girl life and she retaliate by do the same both to blame I be afraid I do not condone anything I have read in this topic but I be just say the damage have be do   people know the truth   sometimes it be just good to let sleep dog lie and try to move on from this it could have be bad and it be not so you be really lucky there good of luck to you and I hope you manage to forgive yourself because unfounately you will most likely never forget

I spend year lash out at the people I love desperately look for someone or something to blame for my bipolar disorder and desperately project my fear anger and confusion onto other in vain effos to dissipate or lessen the pain I feel in time I learn that people patience however much they love you have to be finite for their sake and their emotional wellbeing mental illness always have collateral damage and it be those close to we who suffer when we do now I have a baby daughter I have make a choice that I will always work to protect she from any potential ill my condition bring that primarily involve be active in my wellbeing take responsibility for my behaviour and own my mind again it be far from easy it often take great effo than I be able to give but for her sake and for those I love I keep go good luck to you both x

I have all of these its horrible
I wish I do not have social anxiety even something as simple as go over for a fire and good time make I hyperventilate and break down it be so stupid

I be right there with you   antidepressant   mood stabiliser   night sedation no med for the anxiety though have to deal with those as and when they come what I have learn over over the last   yrs be that the med keep I stable and safe the therapy make life woh live
lamictal its a mood stabilizer I go from a disaster to be able to find happy I do not get stress hive anymore I do not have anxiety attack anymore I sleep pretty well consider I be up throughout the night with my   month old no paranoia I staed at mg go up mg every   week now I be at mg and I have find life again
I take the pill to manage the high low to sleep anxiety and yet sometimes they still do not work
same lyn my   kyle go skate now every tuesday because I be terrify of be around people     hate it but how be I suppose to do thing to exercise when they keep make I sleep make no sense   
I use a nice sativa strain that do not make I paranoid or sleepy I have a nice pick I up to it and motivate I to get out and move also it be a great pain reliever
weru ermkov   wrong strain there be many different strain some will make it seem bad other be a godsend you just need to find the strain that work for you
different type of bipolar could be rapid cycling but good way be to seek professional advice if you be worried about it   
oh this be why I feel like I be dead sometimes great way to make we feel miserable lol but this be true that be why numbness be the bad feeling you will ever get when you have depression
yesbut it be easier say than do sometimes I be afraid frowningface
I still love angie wiltwhat ever mood strike heryes she can a hand full and confusing at time but when I have angie she be the most beautiful perfect person that I would want to spend my life with
scary to be this way
or tell I to just slow down my breathing and breath normal and do not shake        dahhhhh    I can not just make it stop just like that     and it actually hus so bad in my chest that with my first one I think it be a hea attack    so do the er
I be diagnose everything and take a lot of different med and a few have work and I be still take I know the struggle be real but have faith in yourself and you will find the right combination stay strong friend
the bit that concern I as I have read alot about how depression med can make manic depressionbipolar bad I be terrify of get bad as only thing bad I act on my suicide thought when I be manic I can not control my self   
you can just take it an hour at a time then it be not so overwhelming   
I move away from home and when I say away I be talk   hrs away I make excuse not to visit during holiday and I live my life vicariously through phone and web social medium share content until my family staed to drift off I have child I have major life crisis happen and I work with my psych team and the very few so very few friend who actually be let past the fake smile and sarcastic cover up of my mood swing and the fake I do not feel good cancelation until I truly begin to work through the root of my issue and begin some true self acceptance of my condition then I become an advocate speak out to other in need speak up to other just come into therapy just stae out just reach out beg no matter how scary it get and it will get scary please do not run away do not go backwards go forwards slowdown if you need to just do not stop and do not turn around I have be there I have turn around more than once I have stand still stick in place and spin circle even want help wish for help and terrify of what be to come of the next step because get that far be so painful I be the old of our bunch if and bear in the early s   grow up all over the usa with a mother raise in the deep south who marry a pipeliner foreman with control issue from louisiana if that give any of you old guy in here an idea of the issue I have to work through it have be almost   year since I leave home and my dad have new step dad have die my mom first husband the pipeliner die and my mom have become bed bind I still harbor some feeling I know I so as much as I feel like I work through they I know I fall it when I see my mother and she she ask my to care for she in some way that lil kid pop up want to scream and yell everyone can take care of himself can not they and I have to remember that she can not and I be not a kid with my own issue any more take care of an addict
  many label on mental illness forget the stigma of a diagnosis and just work on get well it be hard work and do not be ashamed to seek helpbut be very cautious about prescription they can do more harm than good if dispense from one that be not top notch in this field much over and unnecessary medicate go on
this be the good way I have see this horrible disorder describe ever it be hard some day it be hard but we pay the price always when we come back down from our high and wish we could just crawl under a huge rock because we be so fill with guilt   please do not judge be more understanding
I think my daughter have bipolar for the long but have a wonderful counselor now who have help I see she have bpd similar   but wow really help the caregiver realize how not to feel guilty and the aggregator
this be how to many people feel so horrible hug to anyone fight this fight
sometimes the hard thing be communicate sometimes people be ready and willing to put themselves in your shoe but they can not do that unless you take they off and hand they over by that I mean share what you be think and feel even if you be embarrassed or ashamed of it if all you do be grunt I be not feel well your friend and love one can not imagine what be go on in your head you have to share and that be difficult because anxiety want to hide you do not want to be judge you do not want to bother anyone screw it if someone close to you have make the effo to ask what be wrong make the effo to tell they honestly do not let your illness make you push people away
yesi be go through a horrible down time that have be last almost a year now I feel there not a single person who truly understand what I be go through even the one who say they do underatand I feel like I be drowningi have be have horrible thought of suicide and it be so hard to not think so negativelyi just do not know what to do or where to sta
yes it be very hard I have a paner now and it have be pretty tough for we to get to a point where he can get I to trust he and for he to understand all the quirk about bpd but there be time when stressor can affect we like his favorite cat be run down by a car we be both devastated but somehow our bond be hold we together
I be diagnoise with bi ploal manic depression with panic disorder   my life be a roller coster and my poor family road it everyday with I even if they do not want to   I be put on medication that take serveral year to find a good combo that would at least get I some level of normalcy   not everday be good I still have trouble go to place alone like the grocery store etc   as a single woman now it have leave I to become somwhat of a hermit   I do not like leave my home except to go to work which of course I must do   but I do not date my friend have all go away mainly because I push they away   I still ride the roller coster but not as often   my daughter can tell a difference and for I that be why I continue to take my medication and choose to live   it be difficult I will say and some day I wonder how I have make it this far   but you have to want to live   I do it on my term which be not always the right way in most people eye but I be as happy as any bi polar manic depressed person can be   keep try everyday for the sake of your family because they love you and need you
no one that live around here I isolate so I have no friend except my family my bubble be my world I do not leave except when I see my psych doctor but then my family have to drive I since I will not drive anymore and doctor be about   minute away bipolar anxiety panic ptsd disassociation be hard to deal with too there be no place in the town I live that have suppo group
I be diagnosise bipolar   anxiety depression and ptsd in the area where I live nami have suppo group every night of the week I have meet people that share my diagnosis or if they do not they still understand what I be go thru it be be a huge help for I especially since I do not have any suppo or people that understand
I have bp and anxiety I have depressive moment and hypomania I do not have long moment of depression it only come in moment and the unexplained crying outburst I would not be alive without my med I just wish there be someone at work I could talk too I feel very alone at work not pa of the team     
I deal with bipolar depression and anxiety myself   it be a very hard combo to deal with but I get up everyday someday wish I do not and get dress and do my good to make it through the day if for no other reason than to prove to myself I still can
wow so fucking truewhy do we do this   be there treatment for it without med or naturally if not can I ask what med be prescribe sorry for all the questionsmed from big pharma scare I to death
I have have severe anxiety panic attackssevere separation anxietyptsd from childhood severe neglect emotionally physically to the point of malnutritionbipolar disorderanger outburstsi take   mg of seroquel mgs of prozacativan for emergency for anxiety and severe panictemazepam for sleepand adderrall   mg each daycan barely leave my homeyardand I isolate myself as much as I can for comfoit a toughunfulfilling sadscaryway to live
just happen last night for first time I have never be so scared in my life
I take gabapentin for anxiety it work well
I use to have episode like your my doc will not prescribe benzodiazapine for anxiety because they be addictive and you have to reduce your dosage gradually or you will experience withdrawal symptom not good a couple of year ago my psych prescribe buspar busparone and it completely change my life so effective for my severe anxiety and obsessive compulsive behavior absolutely the good psych med I have ever use lot of the people in my suppo use it and they feel the same way I have no side effect just a little drowsiness when I first   staed   use it I do feel a big difference if I forget a couple of dose symptom will come back I highly highly recommend it
back when I be in highschool I be put on buspar for my anxiety and depression   mom would bring I my med with instant oatmeal and hot cocoa usually for breakfast to take they with before I even get out of bed   it give I such bad tummy ache that I would often be double over in pain for a few hour after take they   I end up have to repeat my junior year of high school because I miss on average   day a week of school   can not pass class when you miss   day first period tapering of to   day th period all in one semester   if I staed feeling well I would go to school late not skip the whole day   what end up work for I be effexor combine with the adderall I be take for add
maybe I should see if I can go back on it use it before for bladder shyness
yes it be so scary I also have extreme anxiety among other thing I be on a couple antianxiety med and they help some but not all together for I when I be at that point I do not know if anything me wise would work of course I be no doctor just try and take it a day at a time sometimes that be all we can do also open up to your doctor maybe they can help
anxiety try breathing exercise
every so often I get really bad chest pain at the sternum and I become unable to take deep breath until it go away   I have go to the doctor a few time over the year for it and each time because I also have shoulder pain they completely ignore the respiratory issue hook I up to an ekg tell I my hea be in perfect condition and send I on my way   one time they say it might be cause by hea burn and to take over the counter med for it   it help the hea burn but not the chest pain   never think it might be connect to my anxiety or depression before   hmm
I get chest pain with my anxiety   not always   but sometimes
I have bad anxiety   I take venflaxin and amitriptyline and I very rarely get chest pain anymore
I have severe anxiety panic disorder and I get chest pain when my brother and I fight and I get all upset and work up I get it I be scared my anxiety may kill I I be on nothing for it right now until I go doctor he will put I on valium he do not know about the chest painsyet it be scary because I think my severe anxiety will just because I to drop dead
I too one treat I like garbage here be your prescription next     then I find this one and I will never look elsewhere I have really bad anxiety and he sense my fear and say candy that be my name   there be nothing to be afraid of here ok   I will not hu you no one will hu you   do not be scared of I because I can be an absolute mess
valium be dangerous if not monitor I would go to a new doctor and get new medication you can not live like that and do not be scared to tell he everything I do that before I be so afraid that the doctor would take my kid away but I get over that delusional thought it bother I terribly but today I discuss every every think
have they monitor your blood pressure whenever my blood pressure go up chest pain be one of the symptom I get
blood pressure be good
I be   year old and cut whenever anxiety be way too much for I sometimes its because of the numbness other time its because I feel way too much pain on the inside I have bipolar   and bpd I take a cocktail consist of   different pill every day some every   hour for some reason cutting be like therapy for I
I struggle quite a bit with this I be bp   and have learn management tool over the past   yrs but sometimes my demon get so horrible and if trigger the right way I lose the battle I try so hard to fight every day the other night even I get so trigger I carve word into myself to dull the pain   you be not alone I have to hide this now from my daughter and everyone it suck
I be   and I struggle with this also
I have bi polaranxiety and depression really bad it be terrible to deal with on a daily basis
I worry now because I say like people yet again see thing about mh
the stigma will always be there I be afraid
bipolardepressionanxiety open page I share a lot about mental illness because I want the stigma to end though I doubt it ever completely go away just like racism   I have be in a mixed mode and I be weary
most people think I be just fake my bipolar to get attention or as an excuse for my weakness it be difficult to ignore they even if I try to not care anymore I have to face they at work with family and friend or friend I be afraid to become so of an hermit
very true   and be not what we want   be a dark struggle and hard battle mental illness self harm   and eat disorder we live everyday and we still alive and survive for live in this eah   but mostly people for ignorance do not understand you and only condenm   you and do not permit we talk about this for they condemn and unkind talk and comment about this   some human do not have compassion and not in our shoe for know and understand this
seroquel work great for my bipolar ragei be also on a few other thing for anxiety and depression good luck
yes that be very true I sta therapy again june st so hopefully that will help I be pretty calm when I be not trigger I be not a very violent or angry person but I just randomly snap when under pressure and I want to learn how to control myself well I appreciate the suppo and advice
I get severe panic attacs and my depression get bad when I do not take it
then let I rephrase my comment latuda work to alleviate depression symptom in bipolar patient my bad what I be try to stress be that there be not a mood stabilizer in this combination of medicine this person be take now let I clarify when I say mood stabilizer most of these medication be actually anticonvulsant drug I be refer to they as mood stabilizer for simplicity purpose
I have the sta also xanax   and for I be a big thing   because I and medication be not big friend         but I have to   because my anxiety be high      but I go to work but I be in a rollercoaster from my emotion so
why not try wake up tomorrow leave all your fear brhind walk out the door and live your life free of fear
I absolutely agree in theory I live a paleo lifestyle   try to avoid medication but for she to simply open her door walk through it   leave her fear behind be probably not doable straight up you say it   she be be live like this for yrs she will need suppo strategy   supernatural strength to make this happen I be not say it can not happen I be say it will take time   a plan blessing  
we need to live free of fear   get outdoor   get fresh air exercise   healthy diet socialize give your life to christ clean one mind and hea of toxicity and say no more   today it end   today be a new beginning free of stigma   free of worry free of anxiety   free of depression sta a new adventure of love   carefree live healthy relationship and jesus in control of it all

so sorry to hear of your loss joy sincerly my condonlence to you and his wife yes I be mighty angry at the fact the pathetic mental health system be just crap they should be ashamed of themselfs to the max they all need to pull there finger out and sta help instead of hinder the system be a shamble I myself have bi polar and be a struggle and a rollercoaster ride but yes more need to be do straight away for many suffer and again joy I be sorry for your loss
I be so sorry for your loss but happy you be speak out to help more of we I be ask for help my insurance drop I and now I be have trouble get my anti depressant I have be off they a week and I have go back to where I use to be strugglingi want to sell my possession and end the pain I have not hu myself but I have think of at least cut so I draw on myself
I have be on it for probably year or so its the one medication that my doctor have never take I off of or change not quite sure why   I be on a pretty high dose of it   I do not quite remember what side effect I have at the beginning but I do have ceain side effect now I normally take it at night before go to bed if I happen to drink or eat anything after take more often than not I get a feeling come over I like I be drunk my doctor could never explain if that be a true side effect but its be happen to I the whole time I take it as well as if I miss a dose that follow day my body be extremely shaky even feel like my body be shake from the inside   and I can not seem to focus correctly until I take it again
the med scare I bad then the mood swing and my own thought
I be diagnose with bipolar   year ago at that time I have become very poorly and try to kill myself luckily my doctor have be fantastic   and spend alot of time get my med right   I refuse to be admit to mental health hospital go every week to a special clinic with other outpatient   my doctor do not think I would ever hold down a full time job but I can say with much pride that I manage to hold down my job for the last   year look after my family and now my grandchild one of which I have special guardian ship of every day be a struggle but I have be bless with a wonderful family and some really lovely friend when I feel an episode come on I go straight to my doctor   if it be bad but I have come to recognise trigger and my husband child and parent also can tell when something be wrong   I will not let the big black nothing get I so poorly again   please if you think there be something wrong do not be scared or embarrassed it be not a bad thing to need help be happy it be your right         
thank you for post this how do a brain know when it be sick   if people just mock they or avoid they it stay the same be patient but persistent on how to deal with trigger it be very difficult dealing with other problem but   if you love they it be woh it when take med make sure the person have show improvement of some kind sometimes there be more than   med for a disorder make sure you eat food that be high in seretonin norepinephrine    etcbecause the med do not produce more of it they just keep the one your body produce from escape their path   die with these disorder your brain do not produce enough of they which cause the disorder just try it   see if you notice a difference just google seretonin etc   find what food you like nutrition be very impoant for the disorder and not many drs and counselor explain this completely where people understand it write down everything so if you forget then it be still right there or have someone you trust go with you to get the info in case you miss something also exercise as much as you can and whatever you can do because the euphoria also help a lot if anyone out there   do not know this please please try this   see if it help or help someone you know with the disorder having work with kid that have brain disorder it be so gratifying when you see they improve keep positive for the one with the disorder because they can not until they be stable              smilingface

hi kristy I just take a look at your profile page be that your beautiful baby girl in that picture   she be precious I know you may feel like you do not matter to anyone right now but I bet you mean the world to she I see you be engage that be something great to look forward to I have kid myself and I have feel like end it all on many occasion I have actually try a couple of time I know you be in a very dark place right now please try to remember these feeling will pass you have people close to you who love you very much and would be devastate if you be take away from they think about my kid have keep I from hue myself many time I know when you be in that state of mind it be hard to realize anyone really care but they do you have to try to remember that here I be a complete stranger and I be very worried about you you be a beautiful young woman with a lot to offer this world   I know you be also strong to have survive depression as long as you have and you be not afraid to reach out to total stranger for help be your fiance understanding of your depression I know it be hard in relationship sometimes but he may be someone you can turn to if you be just look for other to talk to who understand how you feel then I be sure there be many on this forum who would love to talk to you anytime you be welcome to message I anytime just to talk just please think of those who love you and would be very sad if you be not here anymore if the feeling be too bad for you please call the suicide hotline or go to the er if you feel like talk make another post or message I or someone else just please do not hu yourself I promise you these horrible feeling will pass I know you know that deep inside please hang in there
call a suicide hotline and talk to all of we I know life can be rough and overwhelming sometimes do not give up
the big thing that I know to avoid for we be any of the aificial sweetener they break down into some nasty chemical that do not react well with our brain I have be struggle with my appetite so it have be very hard to I to be interested in eat at all but I do so much well on a well balanced diet especially if I can grab a quick snack of veggie or fruit through out the day but like I say I have no appetite so find anything to get I to eat be hard and that make the symptom roar
I would suggest have some blood work do and make sure you be not deficient   in any vitamin or mineral many time people with bipolar or depression be deficient in vitamin d and other thing so you might want to add that to you diet or take a supplement I think   and please do not think I have any science to back I up on this that thing vary from person to person but base on what I see with med that some med work for some people and other work for other I be go to guess that be the way it be with diet too what will work for you might not be what work for other I mean there be some definite thing all bipolar should avoid like alcohol and nonprescribed drug and maybe do not over indulge in caffeine I try to stay under two cup a day but some day I go over that because I love coffee so much other than that I try to eat food that make I feel good some day it be stuff that actually make I feel healthy some day it be stuff that make I feel like I want to live it depend on what so of day I be have fresh fruit and vege be good for everyone lean meat be good for everyone lot of water be good for everyone stay away from junk food and sweet be good for everyone a nice walk be good for everyone
no secret here eat healthy food avoid alcohol caffeine and tobacco
this be the good advice I have get in a long time thank you nicole   thing r lil well today still feel a bit overwhelmed but I know I can get thro this I need to find med that actually work maybe a well doctor
with my husband he say that he do not know how to talk to I anymore we have be together for   year I have be deal with this for almost   year he say he do not know if he can talk to I normally or if he have to treat I like a baby because he be afraid of say the wrong thing and upset I
ha ha if I stop my med that would be the time for they to sta worry
melissa thorn I have terror
I have a supervisor who I have trust and I confide in apparently she notate my file the next supervisor I have become very agitated and afraid of I after she read my file when I ask what be the matter she refuse to answer I so I go to her boss and find out the reason she then refuse to meet with I alone in the same room I be not allow to read my file either I go to human resource after that and request a new supervisor which be turn down I be work in a call center where there be constant noise change interruption you name it all thing that be really bad for someone with bp I end up in the hospital several time and eventually go on sho term then long term disability after that experience I be very careful who I confide in but you betcha I stick up for we when people have blow out idea about bp
well my experience when I try explainin my bp be well I m exactly like thati think what the fuck its so frustratinit not a clubit a horrible thing to deal with but at least be talkin about it and hopefully people might actually carehelp                      
I like that look of terror in their eye let the manipulation begin
I on the other hand enjoy spark terror into the eye of ignorant normie d
I know this feeling all too well but you have to learn to laugh   one time at work year ago I will never forgetthis chic just out in the open office I can not stand bipolar people they scare I   they should all be lock up medicated or not
its true most bipolar and anxiety patient suffer with yoyo sex drive bt this be due to med accord to research I do sex be almost non exsistent so it take you and yr paner to work together to make it work so do not just say its not der   make plan hv date night snuggle take shower and bath together help he and make sure he get back on his med gv it tym your will settle into a routine from there the sky the limit god bless
you say he s not medicate be he in counselingtherapy have you attend such with he if not that might be an option or maybe find a group to try ceain med do that to I thank god my dr decide that class of drug do not help I also have you try positive stress relief basically any safe legal activity that make he smile laugh or feel accomplished have you rule out medical problem I do not like to admit it but some of we need medicate the right med schedule be a well for I than fight it all the time to just scrape by
the only time I feel like sex be when I be manic otherwise I have no sex drive the depression and anxiety destroy it although you try to make it happen it just do not it do not mean he do not love you or not find you attractive its the illness it must be difficult for you it will be for he too but in a different way hope his health improve soon x
proformance anxiety amay be the problem there can be anxiety along with bipolar and when they need to perform in many different area the anxiety go sky high and they just can not no matter how much they may want too nothing to do with love
my boyfriend be ptsd bipolar or possibly bpd he want to have sex sometimes as do I but we do not and have not for almost a year the reason be he be so mean and say such awful thing or most every comment or reminder I make he take as a personal assault this make I withdrawal and afraid of he make it very difficult to be intimate I love and care for he so very much but the hu and anger he exude be an instant and on go turn off it be hard to be open and vulnerable with someone who now blame you for all of his issue I try so hard
when I be in a depressive cycle most of the time I struggle with my sex drive when not medicate as well   then I have zero sex drive a red flag that I be in trouble be when I can not get enough sex it be guarantee that I be head into a hypomanic cycle then
firstlynoone will take yr child from you honey so cross that worry off yr list sound like depression or maybe bipolar please see yr gp   do not ever be scared to tell someone how yr feel hope this help   much love   you yr not alone in this           
they definitely will not take your kid if you r seek help but it do sound like anxiety and some type of mood disorder catch it now because it can get bad get with a dr as soon as possible your whole life will change once they get you see about
you be obviously concerned so my suggestion be to see your dr I would also suggest keep a mood journal list date and time of mood change and how you feel at that time you can then take this journal to your dr and it can be a very effective diagnostic tool you do not always remember everything when you go to see a dr about mental health because of anxiety or poor memory in general
definitely seek help from somewhere it be sound like bipolar ii with anxiety
sound like you have a mood disorder of some sos and anxiety issue   bit that can only be diagnose by a professional so my advice would be to see a psychiatrist no they r not go to take you be kid away because you suffer from depression and anxiety that just do not happen so do not worry about that seek help from you be local county social service or psychiatric clinic good luck always rememver the set sun be a promise for tomorrow   
hi nemo I struggle with my weight through medication also I know you say that diet and exercise do not seem to work but they should just slowly the good advice I can offer be to increase protein fruit grapefruit be a natural fat burner   vegetable iron rich leafy green swap simple carbohydrate for complex one saturate trans fat for unsaturated fat rapeseed oil have the low content of saturated fat and also help reduce cholesterol green tea acai berry supplement raspberry key tone supplement probiotic to aid your digestive system switch to dark chocolate but do not eat it before bed or your body will store it as fat a small eaten in the morning have prove benefit and most impoantly drink as much water throughout the day as you can I fill a jug and put slice lime lemon and ginger root in then stick it in the fridge it be really tasty and good for you hope this help vw
it have different effect for different people do not let some image scare you although abilify do not work for I so I have to switch med

oh myno coddling goin onfckn social medium can bring out the harshness in people be kind   gentle be not molly coddle some of we be just more gentle than other just remembersometime harsh suck it up comment can be enough to push a vulnerable person over the edge please think a little before you post what do not affect you could be devastating to someone else   
I agree lori I personally find that remark uncalled for and a bit upsetting people really aught to choose their word a bit more wisely on social medium paicularly on a page such as this
I think when people be too mentally ill to function or even get out of bed the statement of put your big girl pantie on   can be a very damaging statement yes we be all sick here yes it be all different degree we have be tell our whole life to quote suck it up and it it be a very deep cord for some of we and can seem extremely insensitive always be aware that you never know what other people struggle be
anyone that be gona patronise someone with struggle should keep their stuff to themselveswe all have different struggle united we should stand

well I be so glad you find it that easy and you do that I be not one of those people unfounately there be no way I can work a job at this moment in time and I have not for a number of year that do not mean I be not a big girl I also be a mother to   child I feel a failure as a mother every day of my life because my illness impact so hugely on family life I still can not get up and go to work despite have my kid it be a struggle for I to just get up to feed they some day I have bipolar borderline personality disorder chronic anxiety and ptsd   it be a live hell
I understand felicia I be a single mom n with enough physical n emotional condition to need n want to stop work dailybut I have to feed my daughter n keep a roof over her head every day be a constant struggle but luckily I be still go

I personally have a horrible reaction to latuda doctor stop it immediately and stae I on seroquel xr
I have disable bipolar ii and these comment really show how differently medication work for different people they try to give I latuda for my attituda and I have a horrible reaction I wander from room to room not know what to do unable to think logically the only thought that be go through my head be if this be life I do not want to live it I be very very resistant to try new medication because of latuda they be try to talk I into lemactil now
my son have depress but he do not want to tske med he be on something but it be hard to try and make s   old tske his med very stressful for I at time because I didt no how to help he I be on zofol he be do not want to tsk gl no one so we be do I turn for help for he
I be bipolar   an also a spring depressive when I say depression everyone say oh it must be so hard all winter I just hate it tough to spend every winter so down you must have s a d I   not at all I love winter   they never understand I always feel good in october get job in november and lose they by may that be before med but I still struggle every marchapril to prevent a full episode
I can not remember what I be on but I be have nightmare of my pawpaw and I be wake up around   or   in the morning stay up til bout   or so in the morning then go to sleep my doctor have to change it and then I switch doctor and I get put on celexa for my anxiety and depression
suicide ideation and intrusive thought which be what you be describe be not a reason to be commit to hospital but you should explain they to your therapist as they can be extremely unsettling especially when they be so vivid or will not go away which be very distressing and not under your control they be a symptom of how you be feel and I be sure talk about they will give you some relief
anxiety can cause intrusive thought thing you would never actually do or that do not make sense they be vivid and can be very scary but they be the result of the chemical in your brain work differently your therapist should be someone you trust if you can not trust he or she then find a new one good luck
exactly what be happen to I most night but I literally keep it to myself because I believe anything I say can be twist to my therapist they try to heal what they sometimes can not understand unless they go thru it they have paper that say they be professional in cure or help cope what we go thru but personally some thing be mean to be unsaid if you personally feel like this be not something that be go to occur in life right it in a journal be alot safe and less stress worry if what you say can backlash at youdo not take my statement as advice it be just something that I do to protect myself from be take for ceain word I say in front of someone that have the power to say I be incapable of go home
some med give I weird vivid dream but do not worry dream do not count
pretty sure they can only do that if you admit you want or plan to harm yourself if you explain to your therapist your dream just how you do here I be sure it will be ok I can not imagine how stressful and unsettle those dream must be it would be good to talk to she about it
it be like people do not even read it be more of the lying to she clearly say he want to but lie about it and the fact that their relationship have change and he be clearly not invest in it I have no advice   I live by the rule of do I spend more day happy than sad if not what be the point   for I it get to the point I want to kill myself I feel so horrible   there be something to be say for have stabilityespecially for kid but if you all be miserable and not connect they pick up on that   a conversation need to happen clearly though   focus on fact not feeling
I have the same problem it be hard   I have an episode in feb where I do not sleep for   day I be not medicate because I lose day in my mind I end up be so paranoid that I go crazy on my love one have a break between fantasy and reality I go off on his mom and my entire family   now he seem embarrassed to b w I she will not forgive I and everyone think we should break upi have multiple diagnosis but he have a hard time understand they we have be together   yrs he drink a lot but now be sober I want to marry he but I be not sure I be ready to explain my illness to everyone who already have I label as crazy   I have say sorry and that it will not happen again I knoe my trigger and symptom and have a lot of suppo and have help to get through the bad day   do not know if it be to break or woh save   life be hard enough and I can not beg anymore for forgiveness
I understand about get marry especially since you have be engage that long it be like why propose in the first place if he do not plan on marry you if he can not do that then it be a show of not be able to commit and now that he be change I do not know I would sit down and have a long talk with he about his intention and where he want to be with you and why he do not want to get married communication be everything do not let the anxiety talk for you either write down the point you want to talk about while in a clear mind
if he treat you and the kid good then do not worry about getting marry   it be how he suppo you and the kid that be most impoant
yep   it be bad when I be stress out
I use cannabis it really help I no pain no depression no anxiety no bad side effect
firstly why do you stop you also do not say what med you be take it be not a good idea to just suddenly stop some med have dreadful withdrawal symptom and you really should gradual dose reduction over a few week
I agree I write letter and I keep a diary due to some day I can not remember what I be upset and angry for bless you sweetie xx
thank you that be one of my big struggle I be like this but not depress
it be so so hard it be also hard to advise or even suggest what work for other as your individual case be just that   I just know that when you be feel as bad as you obviously be and can not see the wood for the tree it be so difficult to know what to do for the good   for my recovery the first major step be acceptance and I suspect you be at that stage where you be fully aware of your illness and be not pretend to yourself or other   the next step be take responsibility for yourself and your recovery which you be now try to do   these be major step which you should feel proud of and be far from easy to embrace and admit   many live with mental illness in relative secrecy so if you do have people who care and you care about it must help but it must be so tough for those around you but I be sure they will do all they can however hard it be   at the end of the day you all want the same thing to get you well I feel I want to escape I think that be quite common   not not to be here but to escape from the torment and pain   to escape that torment the answer be to get well there be hope which you must hold on to   I have month day after day on the sofa today I can enjoy the tiny thing   there be hope   unfounately it be not easy to recover it be a long hard road but ultimately I think we all have the strength   I have to do it alone no one know or if they do they do not care enough   I be adamant I would not take anti depressant see a counsellor or take sleep tablet   I be frightened and not in control in the end I take the lot   recovery from mental depression be often a huge mixture of small step whatever work well for you if you have love one lean on they let they help   it be down to small step achievable goal when you be ready try to come up with a plan small but significant step to move forward and get you well   try to pinpoint what be not work what you need to change take each day as it come be kind to yourself people need you and love you you can do this for they but mainly for you there be light there be colour there be hope xxx
I be against med but it will be the good for you to be reevaluate by a different psychiatrist with a new approach give the quick release med a week or two you will be sleepy and relaxed and if you do not feel well I would try a sho term hospital stay preferably private room noise and lot of people might escalate your anxiety long term med will kick in in   week and by then you should feel almost human cognitive therapy be of utmost impoance psychiatrist usually work hand and hand with a psychologist   month and your a for a way I find the holistic approach favorable take much long   but it work research scio healthlife natural healer association good luck your not alone you will get well believe in yourself hope love faith
it sound like you be very blessed to have a husband and friend that care so much worry about you right nowget the helpyou will be happy you do in long run wish you the good
I be so sorry your go through all of this your hubby and bf love you   and only want the good for you they do not want you to hu any more you need to go and hopefully you will not feel quite so bad just remember you be love by your family your bf and by all of usredhea just hang in there and get the help you so desperately need please   redhea
it hus but usually if it be a good hospital it help a lot if you cut yourself you go husband can take care of horse for a few day if I do not have   thing to do I think I would admit myself up and down hate live but my family be everything depress severely or manic and confused
it be possible but if that be not your diagnosis then do not get extra worried about it let the doctor do his job about diagnosis and you work on get well take your med and go to therapy if your med be not work right get an appointment for a change
side effect I experience most be shakiness and severe tremor once dose be lower it go away otherwise it work well no suicidal thought
bad one for I be the shaking and the nausea
my son be on it for year with good result screw up his thyroid and much later on give he horrible acne almost boil on his back   after year it quit work then there be the blood test but I would say it be woh a shot in take some people know right away if they can not take it because of the blood work
I like lithium but it give I nightmaresnight terror
I could not keep it down   I would take it and then   minute later vomit it be miserable
make sure to have blood level check if you take lithium mine be not be monitor and overdose for month with alot of uncontrollable vomiting
lithium work great for I until I find out I be pregnant after I be do breastfeed I get back on and it be horrible for I severe insomnia hallucination could not drive vision change
I be lithium for almost yrs   I never have a problem   but every person be different on kilodopin for anxiety   albilify for paranoia good luck
paranoia and anxiety both be largely increase on lithium suidical thought for I be daily too lithium and depakote be terrribleeeeeee for my mental and physical health but everyone be different I have hear more bad then good about lithium though
be careful I be no doctor but that sound like a very scary mix I wish you the good
I really struggle with this for year I do not take vacation because I do not think single people do that my psychiatrist convince I to go on a regular cruise and that really open up my perspective I can have fun by myself because I push myself to meet at least one new person wherever I go just one person be not overwhelming when I get home I apply the same principal I meet one new person at the grocery store aisle in the checkout line at the park at church or the movie its really surprising how friendly and reassure that one person can be
I do not know struggle with this myself
hello colinim   I ve have mental health prob all my lifei hate bein single n alone but I lean to love bein alone music be a great way of distress watchin comedys be also greatit really boil down to be happy in you be own skinonce you ve master that n enjoy you be life it will attract peep to youkeep strong xox
ativan be a dangerous medication if you be prone to addiction at all or not it be very addict I have a horrible time withdraw from it after attempt to end the pain it build up in the fat cell in the body and require more and more to feel well medication can help many but benzodiazepine be not   a good choice some may be able to comply and not take more than prescribe but it be still damage I be not a doctor but one who have a lot of experience from the last   year as you can see I feel very strongly about ativan I wish the good for all of you hue it can get well please continue to fight it
but for many it do work if any medication be cause an issue you have to address that with your psych doctor and yes I know it be hard sometimes I have bipolar   anxiety ptsd and personality disorder bipolar since childhood
I too be a survivor of suicide attempt   in fact what get I be whenever there be some celebrity that actually succumb to the thought that many of we have know it get horribly blow up in the medium   for those of we who have survive every time this happen there be a range of emotion that you experience you can talk to your therapist but somehow it just be not enough   what I be try to do be sta a suicide attempt survivor group that would be lead either by a therapist or social worker I be try to work out the detail with the agency where I have my social worker both my therapist and my social worker think it be a great idea there be group for family who have lose a love one but not for we   I think it be time for one
psychiatric med do because more harm than good I be on some and it cause sleepiness disorientation slur speech nasty taste in mouth sporadic behavior uncontrollable communication or action depend on p
its very impoant especially wth bipolar with panic attacksanxiety and depression that you take your medication that work right for you do never throw yr med away and stop you will eventually go bad till its very serious situation stay well and take your medication without fail
I be sadden by his passing but hope it will help some have conversation with love one friend and their doctor about their medication risk and treatment plan
I think unfounately we live in an age where its easy and more common to ask for advice on a social medium page rather than get correct information from a professional health care worker   I see so many people ask for help or advice on medication on facebook and I can not help but to think why do not you just ask a psychiatrist   sadly I think this be due to the fact that many people all across the world do not have easy or affordable access to mental health professional   australia nz usa and many more country I have live in have very poor suppo for people with mental health issue    my advice be this   always check with a doctor before change dosage or stop any medication   I know that many medication can cause increase risk of depression anxiety or suicidal thought but there be also many that do not it take time to find the right medication sometimes and it can be a tedious process I also be a suicide survivor and speak for myself I would not be here without my medication   keep fight the good fight people
yes you could very well call the member of this site a community because we all have something in common   would you be offend if you be a red sox fan and the announcer refer to you as be pa of red sox nation   I highly doubt it
be you be medication compliant do you have a rescue plan for anxiety attack
my goal be to one day not need so much medicine my doctor have tell I she have no other med I have try they all I do not trust all in med I have decide when I get the time to go back to yoga I obviously have anxiety from all the year of abuse from child good until an early adult
yeah I usually be good about take my med the pharmacy take forever to fill my depression med because they have to get a pre authorization if I be not take they I become maniac and high on life my counselor know when this occur let we see when I have anxiety attack usually I take my pill or I breathe or I shake until it go away by talk myself out of it
this be something I post alot about because it help I alot be medical marijuana if you do the right research and really look into it it could really help you like most medicine you do need to be careful when first try it as it be not for everyone    I have an overwhelming amount of loss and trauma in my life and it be the only thing I use because I have problem with ingest thing to hu myselfso if you have not already it might be something to look into
do you go to counseling or therapy to help you cope and work on your grief I would do that first and foremost then get into an aa place stop drink its not benefit you on anyway shape or form   from their work with your doctor   or psychiatrist to cut down on some of those add medication that you might not need once you be in counseling and able to deal with anxiety and grief and also with the drinking because that be do a number on your system as well I can not understand what you be go through but I have be addict to drug in the past and then on multiple antidepressant and antianxiety pill which I be no long on if anything from where anybody be suggest to you and try to help please get into counseling and if you do not like your first counselor find another one it be totally woh it it be hard it be frustrating it bring up feeling you do not want to face   but it be totally woh it to gain your sanity and your selfwoh and a purpose in life
I be a mixed bipolar with severe anxiety but my mental dr put I on latuda which have help I a great deal
you just have to find one that work for you I try   for my anxiety til I find one that work
this be my story thank for your reply I always have anxiety and bi polar but after my son be diagnose   be when depression really hit
also do you exercise   I find that to help so so much with my anxiety and depression and even my mood swing from my personality disorder   I stop take med completely for   month due to the seroquel give I memory loss and a stutter and I feel x well than I ever do on med I staed take a multi vitamin and exercise daily and I be feel great   the only reason I be back on meazapine be to help I sleep because I have really bad insomnia but it also help majorly with my anxiety so if I feel anxious I wil take a med that day and be well   I do not take they every day
in my opinion get off the seroquel that shit be so bad for your brain   I find it make everything in my life worse hard to deal with emotion hard to control my mood swing have I memory loss and cause I to stutter   the only thing it help I with be sleep and even then I be see shit and hear shit in my sleep I would not recommend it for anyone my uncle have schizophrenia and bipolar and I even tell he to get off the shit he be   well than he be on it   I highly recommend meazapine for an anti anxietyanti depressant as I to have try many different one and this have work the good for I I have little to no anxiety most day   everyone who I have tell to try this have all have major turn around and good result   everyone be different with medication but I think it be woh a try   goodluck
I find olanzapine mg and go gym work also avoid alcohol
thuis be go olanzapine   also for anxiety    
I have never be in a   long term love relationship and I be   they just last a few week and they can not handle the darkness so I just completely stop look for a paner and without any real friend around I stae focus on what I can do on my own I stae on a healthy diet cook good healthy food I go for walk every other day down by the seaside with some dark   not sad music the sight of big wave crash violently on the rock calm I down as for a relationship I think it might come my way maybe not I believe stress about it will not help I but it will drag I fuher deep into depression I hope my sho story help good luck

akathisia a feeling of muscle quiver restlessness and inability to sit still sometimes a side effect of antipsychotic or antidepressant medication

thank you so much for the comment and advice everyone I be really overwhelmed by the suppo
I have rapid cycling bipolar I think everyone with bipolar have the chance of a sudden rapid cycling circumstance environment moon phase time of year hormone if its not normal for you then make someone close to you aware of what be happen its hard to keep track and you will not see the shift yourself its okay just breathe if that be all you can do concentrate on that and the loud fast rushing will get quieter if you havnt experience it before it be very frightening try write whenever you can then when your well sift through it all you will remember the day and maybe be able to sta identify sign and your own red flag behaviour that signal a change I hope someone close be help you through try and keep people in your loop take care l x
twice a year I rapid cycle just like this I have be diagnose with bi polar since   and be now   I have also be diagnose with schizo effective disorder agoraphobia ocd and anxiety and I be now on tygretol and wellbutrin xl and have be stable for almost   year but recently have have the psychosis return and be put on sulpheris   sorry spelling that one suck I totally get ya so many different combo so much happen I hate it the spinning but with med and suppo we will all get through it hug n positive thought your way
I have rapid cycling bipolar the swing be unbelievable just one straight after the other my depression never last long or never happen at all because I be straight back up there I appear to drop from full blown mania to hyper mania then back up again I be put on olanzapine lithium and an anti depressant can not remember which one I have be on that many these med send I totally the other way I be a zombie anxiety and depression really bad just could not lift my depression at all and the anxiety be so bad I want to die   any way after try lot of different type of mood stabiliser and anti depressant I have now find what suit I I too be on lamotragine also risperidone and my antidepressant be venlofaxine I feel well than I ever have I still have bout be just mild it take a long time to get there and I think I never would keep take the lamotragine and hopefully it will be your saviour too good luck x
honey get out and   distress your baby need that
first thing do not get overwhelmed change the small thing you can manage first break it down to small task some be unchangeable erase all guilt and or self pity sta with you be daughter and dog look on the bright side wen you can for instance no water damage that could have be bad make urself happy before you begin to look for sumbody   suicide be a permanent solution to a temporary problem   not preach I jus know be you be at   get out in the sun around nature and people we   do not want our child see we like that it can be a learn behavior   hope I help at all
we be listen     it seem like you be go though a lot right now do you have a psychotherapist I find it be really helpful talk to someone who understand mental illness she make it about I and my feeling as a person not my illness and help I find way to cope and deal with stress so I can stay ground I suggest psychotherapy to help you through this difficult time
that be a lot of thing to be deal with all at once without enough money or enough suppo it must feel overwhelming you have a lot of responsibility and thing you be try to solve but you need help I be not sure how to help but I think some of it will work out somehow if you have a little patience first one thing will be solve then another until you be in a different situation and state of mind it may not seem possible to solve these problem now because so much be happen at once but thing will change it be so great that you rescue two pitbull that be a wonderful thing for you to do they be not always so lucky to have someone like you help they keep on help they and love your daughter one day at a time the other stuff be less impoant make sure you be on some good medication that work for you because you need to be stable while go through these challenge
hi there so sorry for all your trouble with so many anxiety you be deal with negative circumstance will only add to your dilemma you seem very confuse even on little thing and I understand because of the mental illness I would suggest a simple step it be still up to you though since you know yourself well than I do    get a piece of paper and write down all your problem   put big problem small problem in a column and think through which one you want to prioritize first then second third and so on this might seem silly to you but our perspective normally change when we see in write that some problem be not really woh worry too much about and yet some problem also need quick action on our pa redhea this might help as well see the link take care redhea
sound like you need to visit the doctor you seem a bit confused you could be bipolar but you be not actually very clear about what you be say go and see the doctor and have a talk
I think she want to know she be not alone and that someone care maybe get some advice from other in similar high stress situation about how to deal everything she be go through    
she be speak about her battle   look for some comfoing word if not suggestion to help her situation compassion never hu anyone every person who be a pa of this page would appreciate this I find your comment unnecessary if you do not know what she be ask if anything do not comment if it be on my post I would be upset
I would just say to you it be very early day and it be normal to be look at the service sheet etc you be come to term with your very sad loss and you be probably in so much shock you think it be a nightmare you will wake up from   you do not want it to be real   if you be struggle then contact a bereavement association or councillor   its never weak to ask for help it be our strength that permit we to admit we be struggle   even medication can help you through   but remember it be very early day a week be no time at all
yes I have sever postpaum depression after my second child   it be the scary thing I ever go through   I do not have this when my daughter be bear   I have always have depression   but when my son be bear it be unbelievable   I have thought of want to kill my own son   I want he to be another girl   I know that this be not I but I could not stop the thought from come   luckily we have a close friend that be a neurologist that tell my husband to get I to the doctor right away   it still take almost   month for I to recover on med   I could not remember how to write my own name   if I shower I could not remember if I wash my hair or put on my conditioner   please get to a psychiatrist and begin treatment for this right away it can get bad it be dangerous for you and your child or child feel free to message I if you need to talk   do not wait to care for yourself   you need to care for yourself first so that you can care for other s later
that pretty much sum up my ptsd   anxiety
funny these all fit we be more anxious due to the fact that we see and understand more of what we see go on around we and it stress we
seriously I have always think my ability to think reasonably clearly in very chaotic and stressful environment be a very minor superpower I think it be due to be bring up by doctor and nurse but this suggest my neurodiversity might be pa of the reason recent add diagnosis add to anxiety and depression
adhd anxiety and depression whuuuut why be I not the good damn person in the world yet xd
creativity come in lot of form it be not just about draw or play piano     anxiety depression and add mean I be a compassionate and creative problem solver
it really be   I have have personal experience of this it be very frightening
panic attack anxiety attack be not good I be just thankful my medication work because mine get so bad I end up at the er
thank sagaren lm so happy that you find the strength to conquer the feeling of insecurity and lack of self woh I pray that through your post above many will see a seed they can plant and be able to implement the three step to self healing we need our med perhaps for the rest of our life but as with diabetes or hypeension our mind may need these too these various chemical be critical to stabilize the much need balance and hopefully we find that balance the rest be up to we and even more critical l believe we have to stop all the inwarddirecte thought I have I have I have sorry everyone sure we have   but with the practice you outline above we can begin to make even one small shift in our mind one small shift of mindset today follow by another small shift next month follow by more and more and bring some small degree of happiness to ourselves   all by ourselves what an achievement go tell your docpsych what you have achieve tell your family   no show they the new you you have the power it lie within the mind that make you dwell on the negative try hard to be kind to yourself learn to love yourself find the happiness and joy that lie   within you send everyone struggle and hue all my love I shall keep you in my prayer love and shower of blessing film  
I will ask a question to answer do you notice any think pattern activity time of day place you go where you notice your mood shift dramatically or be it more sporadic I believe do your own research that the former be normal in people with bpd and feature in bipolar ii not as familiar with ptsd yet but I be stae my own research on that one however you would know yourself good and if this feel different or worry you that it feel bad than usual hit up your therapist   medical team for advice
amen to that I have bipolar pstd ocd anxiety panic my brain be full
yes I have sever postpaum depression after my second child it be the scary thing I ever go through I do not have this when my daughter be bear I have always have depression but when my son be bear it be unbelievable I have thought of want to kill my own son I want he to be another girl I know that this be not I but I could not stop the thought from come luckily we have a close friend that be a neurologist that tell my husband to get I to the doctor right away it still take almost   month for I to recover on med I could not remember how to write my own name if I shower I could not remember if I wash my hair or put on my conditioner please get to a psychiatrist and begin treatment for this right away it can get bad it be dangerous for you and your child or child feel free to message I if you need to talk do not wait to care for yourself you need to care for yourself first so that you can care for other s later

ok yes I get this but I have one point to make and please do not get too mad at I for this sometimes give up on someone even someone with a serious mental health issue that be in no way their fault it the right thing to do not because the person be not woh the time or effo to suppo and help they in any and every way you can but because be with that person whether be their friend or significant other be physically or mentally damaging for you I know someone who have some serious issue that be in no way his fault   I want to help he and do everything I could to try and help he but be with he be seriously damaging for I my mental health be in no way as bad as his but I still have issue with anxiety and depression and be in that relationship mess I up more than I could cope with so I end up give up because it be the only way out I could see where I do not end up kill myself something I would be close to at time because of this person action   tldr I be not say you should not do anything you can to suppo people with mental health issue and be there for they to help they but if it be physically or mentally damaging for you then you should not sacrifice your own health for someone else no matter how much you want to help they
yeah but people without a mental illness do not seem to get it they say they understand but their patience dissolve into frustration which no doubt it be frustrating but how much more be it for those with the illness it be like with any illness ailment disease disability or limitation it be hard to put yourself in that person shoe but it be always bad for they

this zee person obviously do not know a single thing about the reasonorigin of the cause of the various condition of the mind they be extremely complex in origin and after all the century of medical investigation and expeise the medical professional can still only hazard a guess and experiment with the thousand of drug available to try to obtain a combination that work single parenthood   most ceainly not it be easy to be judgemental until it strike you   so I would tread very lightly before another careless word be type here it could just because the push over an edge that for some of we be a very narrow one I be bp after a severe head injury as a teenager and it change my entire lifeand have worsen as the year stress and misfoune have take their toll so the stress and misfoune cause by the illness exacerbate the condition which cause more impulsive and wrong decision which lead to more stress and misfoune so please be careful what you say to someone word once they leave your mouth can not be take back and the effect they can have on many may be an eternal sentence of doom but I forgive you for your comment ignorance be bliss but be warnedyou may need our advice someday
sorry zee I be the   year old I be marry for   year   baby to that one man too may I add just in case bipola be cause by have kid to different man my mother and father have be marry for   year last feb and she too also suffer depression and anxiety my father always by her side no matter what so that marriage shit you can put it up your nose n blow it outta your bum dumb thing that come out of some people mouth can and will one day push that suicidal person over the edge get nothing nice to say keep it to your self hope to god you do not ever be in a place not only be I in but s of people too

I have be on bipolar med antidepressant anxiety med sleep meds adhd med etc spend time in amsterdam   where its legal find that marijuana treat all these problem they be even more affective than what big pharm have to offer now that you do not have to smoke it I   can not see any reason not to use it medicallyexcept its illegal even if you qualify the clinic need your other drs approval I really do not see that happen too often most drs want to keep you as a repeat customer so most drs be not go to give approval
I suffer from depression and anxiety usually last about three week but I try to focus on family and work before I get on med I be a complete mess
I be diagnose with bipolar disorder over a decade ago and I use to self medicate until it almost kill I now I be take a more holistic approach meditation have help I immensely and be prove to lower stress level and a ton of other benefit that be the only thing I can recommend but I too sleep a lot and find it extremely hard to leave the house but the rage have definitely decrease a lot and I know it be because of the meditation I do I need to be more adamant about make it a daily practice instead of wait til I be way far off kilter and have to meditate my way back to sanity but it do help to some degree I just do not know if I can do the whole lab rat thing anymore I have be on probably    different med over the year sometimes   prescription at a timeand meditation have help I more than any of they I can only speak from my own experience but I think everyone can benefit from meditation and it be woh look into you might be surprise by what exactly meditation isa well as what it be not good wish
honestly my good resource have just be youtube I would sta with a video call something like buddhist monk explain meditation it be a really good place to sta because the video explain exactly what meditation be and be not if you can not find the video I be speak of let I know and I will find you the link meditation be a deeply personal thing and I think it should be customize to what serve each person good and the great pa about it be you can literally do it any time during any activity its more about retrain your brain rather than try to clear your mind of all thought feel free to add I as a friend and I will help in any way I can I know the struggle and if I can help lighten the load for one person or help they find some hope and peace that would help I as much as they   hope you find this helpful
yes my thought exactly I be on a lot of medication and live with the side effect everyday because my   kid need a mum who be semi functional if I do not take I meds woaah scary stuff can happen
not many drs prescribe lithium anymore as there be well   new   one   my boyfriend on lithium and the change have be amazing we naturally have lithium in our brain but a lot of depression   anxiety   etc come from our lithium level be outta whack   should definitely see a dr and ask to get his level check and hopefully sta he on it
I think it will be the good med for your boyfriend without a doubt   
amber I understand when I be first get sick and a few time in between the road be quite bumpy it be not a good journey and very scary you be probably the first person that he lash at because he love you and you be the close person to he   you need to take care of yourself as well especially if you suffer with depression sometimes you will have to distance yourself if you can for selfpreservation the good medication for I have be lithium plus amisulipride and duloxeteine I think the lithium be a universal med and available in the us it be one of the old type of medication but it be reliable and it work well maybe it will be woh have a conversation with the doctor tomorrow about it   
you can take natural stuff for the ache and to reduce the inflammation in your body you can take ginger in a shakeor tea sperilina activate charcoalbathe with epson salt essential oilswhite willow bark accupunturemassage stretch very dayhot yoga juice fast but still take your med on the juice fast sanas steamroom meditation   there a couple that the stuff that have work for I I not a doctor but I reaserche alot about depressionand all that stuff have work for I hope it help
for I massage therapy work wonder on my body get regular massage can really help with the pain associate with depressionanxiety drink lot of water can aid in the muscle not be as tight when the pain be bad and I can not get to a massage session I take ibuprofen but be careful as too much can mess your stomach up   oh and get a new doctor this one that you have be wrong
I get intense deep muscle ache all the time it be not in my head either it be the bad pa of my anxiety disorder I have over the counter wrist brace for when my finger burn and those help I use a lot of icy hot and that help for a bit as well I reluctantly take aspirin but it do help a bit too those be the only thing I can do anymore myself I hope this help you a bit it be not in your head an it may not even be the medication depressionanxiety do take a physical toll or as I have one doctor explain to I all pain be biologically in your head pain be real
I have find bath body work stress relief help it come in bath and lotion form   ingredient be spearmint and eucalyptus
I get an irritation feeling in my body like someone scratch on the chalkboard   I also have fibromyalgia and I take a pain pill or tumeric tumeric work well than pain pill get a medical doctor to test you for fibromyalgia my body ache when I get stress or eat too many sweet
I take welbutrine to help with the irritation trazadone help with insomnia
interesting michelle that you mention that you get that irritation feel in your body bcuz I be experience that I do not know a good way to describe it but that be it I be diagnose bipolar last year and general anxiety   I currently take   mg seroquel   mg celexa   mg paxil and   mg xanax at night but I just stop take the xanax a few day ago but now I be wide awake       anyway I have that same odd sensation I be go to mention to my dr next week
fibro and bipolaranxietyborderline here turmeric as in the spice like my dad use in pickle stuff I have never hear of that stress and temp change overly hot or cold be my main trigger stress have be off the chas lately due to new medical issue be diagnose so fibro have join the pay big time
I ache all over   it take I about half an hour to rev my joint up   I find spo relieve my ache painful body but it take real self motivation to do as I doubt my ability then the anxiety and headsweat kick in but I have to do it to keep supple and I feelat my good when I do spo
I have the same issue my old dr move away and the new one do not get why after   year he have I on vicodin and xanax because nothing else work trial and error of psych med nearly kill I more than once I can not take ibuprofen or gabapentin due to pancreatitis but new dr be so worried about they be addictive and high risk for resale if my old doc trust I for so many year with never miss a follow up test and never ask for more or high dose why not give I what we know work
first get a new doctor because a doctor that be tell you that it be all in your head be a piece of shit second I take mg of ibuprofen   time a day I know it be a lot but that be what it take when thing get really bad like from my ra my doc will give I a single script of morphine or vicodin I have also find that weight blanket be fabulous for body ache I have one that weigh   pound and believe it or not it help calm anxiety attack too
if I try to go without it   I need to do it three time as much and try to restrain myself drive I nuts and I think about it all time church do not help it just make I feel guilty    thank god I just masterbate alot to cope with it to keep the craving down   I love masterbate   I think everyone do
thank you that be be the only way for I I could not go out there to find satisfaction for it would weigh heavy on my conscience I would never be able to forgive myself for use another for my own personal needgain   I do not judge other to each his own right I just be not brave enough to try   it would have be more satisfying no doubt there be also the fear of be reject I do not think that would have happen but the fear be always there   but for I my butterfly be my favorite   the urgency can and have happen away from home   tmi   my apology
my sex drive have go to litterly nothing over the last   yrs I be   I feel sorry for my husband in a way but I can not give in to his need because than I would feel diy use etc and I refuse to do that to I yes I do hear about well back when you be a teenager or in tour early s you enjoy sex or he threaten to go elsewhere and I have staed to say ok go if you need I be work on I right now and clearly you do not understand what I be go through I have aniextypanic attack sever depression bipolar ptsd ocd chronic fatigue
I have almost no libido at all and I be diagnose with bipolar depression bipolar ii I also have other mental illness as well like panic disorder and terrible anxiety but could also be my med either way I do not think that one symptom override all the other get a second opinion
I agree this be something that no one talk about because you get call name what people do not understand be that it be really a sickness and an overwhelming addiction it ruin my first marriagepraise jesus he help I through it I have be a faithful wife for   year on my second marriage redhea
and the guilt be excruciating
the guilt nearly crucify I and like you say no one to talk to I totally empathise here have feel exactly the same if this be a closed group I could talk more feel free to pm I if you want to talk x
more scary than anything my period staed and do not stop for six month pergesterone stop your period estrogen make you ovulate and because testosterone be produce elsewhere I now have alot of unwanted hair across my body which I be insecure about and that definitely do not help the libido issue but after that all happen they try I on lithium which make I overly suicidal so get take off it and they do not want to try any other med because of the issue so have have to do a bunch of therapy to teach I other way to cope and try to control the swing and recognize they etc it be hard and definitely not easy to be with I just hope we can so out our issue and fix thing before it be too late
I be so sorry that sound miserable
do not ever give up your medication as this be only complimentry as well as it can not get rid of the chemical imbalance that it be always take med when its a very serious mental condition it be an horrendous time when some stupid new dr tell I to stop take some tab and try other   but stop straight away after   odd year of take they all hell break loose panic attack every day eventually after quite a while to be honest they finally find the right mood stabiliser as they say I have be on anti depressent that just make I manic more they never diagnose bi polar till   year ago
lamictal save my life staed on   upped very slowly to avoid rash now on   mg be on it   yrs I be bipolar   psychiatrist have have to adjust antidepressant over the year to keep depression at bay but mania be control perfectly and the constant roller coaster of mood be go I use to cycle a lot my daughter be bipolar   as well and be on   mg lamictal also
I find it take month for lamictal to kick in and I struggle for month and still do   if you be concerned talk to your doctor because there be other stabilizer out there   I wait to talk to my doctor until I be on a stable dose because it keep go up until the doctor think it be appropriate to stop up the dosage
I can relate to what you be go through   I be struggle right now too   just have a bad reaction to a new drug I recently stae   yes it get extremely frustrating at time but please know you be not alone   I have struggle with most of the available mood stabilizer   in fact there be only one I have not yet take   I do not respond well to these med so my psychiatrist recently recommend genetic testing   that be be a real eye opener and   finally explain why there be problem take ceain med   I recommend to anyone who have be unsuccessful with medication
talk to your dr about this there be other pill than lamictal find the right combo of pill can be horrible but you will get there
if reach out to I be something you feel may helpi am here and I have shut many out on my journey and be so scared it be like I will never walk out the door live alone trap for many monthsso I mean it when I say I be here for you
I do not like this stuff my anxiety be horrible and anxiety medication do not help much I be off all medication now because I be pregnant and feel much much well I hope you feel good soon redhea
unfounately get the right dose and play lab rat sometimes be need to find the right med at the right dose it take I   mth to find that lithium miazapine and olanzapine work for my bipolar i and anxiety I know all to well the limbo you feel you need to speak with your psychiatrist and tell they how you feel open honest communication be key I keep a mood journal and practice cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness there be plenty of resource on the web and mindfulness app for your phone take care

I have take it for psychiatric purpose it do not agree with I but I think I be more of the exception than the rule a friend of mine that have al take it for her al it can be use for nerve pain as well lyrica be the good for nerve pain however lyrica induce depression in I I have hear so many use for it although I also have never hear it prescribe for anxiety do not be discourage by my experience I have meet plenty of people that it work well for stay in close touch    be totally honest with your dr be patient its well woh it in the end
just remember everyone be different they give it to my adult son for anxiety and for some nerve damage he have   it help no side effect and do not have a hard time get off of it   unfounately it be trial by fire for all drug but it be also a process of elimination too   god speed
do not work for only because maybe I have be on benzo for ten yrs nothing be well for anxiety then benzo they eat addictive though
I just stae it two week ago I also take prozac and geodon I have bp   so far it make I feel like I be in a fog I have a hard time wake up several night I have confuse dream with reality and vice versa I have not be   bother enough by the side effect to stop take it
I take gabapentin for fibromyalgia but my anxiety be still really horrible I do not even know it be prescribe for anxiety
seratonin syndrome put I in the hospitali feel horrible and have terrible side effect
I have be an right now almost   year but have not be able to work almost   with all hose year nursing and my own psych history I can honestly say his be the first I have hear of gabapentin be prescribe for anxiety I be very familiar with it for neuropathy I be not knock it because doc prescribe med for other than their intend purpose all the time just say this be first I ever hear of it weird I have take some of my boyfriend try to ease this nerve pain I be have that doc do not believe I have and I can say it do not do shit for my body bad nerve or my anxiety either so

future problem worry about the now sweet lady  
I do not doubt your grandfather wise word it be a matter of my anxiety make it difficult to believe that
a piece of advice I be give by my grandfather that always hold true be   of what you worry about never happen if you can just try to go by that your thought should sta to settle down
thank you sometimes it be my way of closure but sometimes it can be my down fall my major problem be that it keep on work all the time so many thought and no break   within my mind I be always think my mind be never silent and it be always about thing that most in the world do not think about nor worry about thus make I feel like I be slowly go insane I feel like I be stick in a world of people that be unaware of the hidden danger amongst the many I so rarely find people that think the same as I and view thing truly open minded I be self aware of my own fault as well as other it be a blessing and a curse all together
I can really understand and feel the way it be a daily struggle you just write everything I go thru n feel I have anxiety ptsd bpo   I self harm alot more then ever now cuz all I hear be how I be not good enough and I can not do anything right
it could but the horror of it all be that you carry this darkness around all the time and there be many moment when all of that stuff do not matter to you anymore I understand everyone have some type of problem in life but I would honestly rather be homeless and starve than deal with the shit that go on inside my mind
another small gem give I by a beloved friend that my attitude be more impoant than the fact and it be not about what happen to we it be what we do with what happen to we which will determine whether we go up or down and something lve struggle with for awhile up to last friday our negative thought create our own reality and the good little cliche lol our attitude determine our altitude   find something to laugh about read some funny joke online watch a funny movie take a walk on the beach see all the beauty surround we rejoice and you shall rejoice again one day you shall again know happiness and peace each one of we hold the seed to our own unhappiness within we but we also hold our happiness there we be leave to make the choice and remember that our happiness do not lie in our paner or in thing let we choose to be happy bless you

take your husband   to your doctor when you next go if he s a decent doctor he should make he perfectly aware of how serious an illness this be that be nothing to be ashamed
that be shameful of yr hubby to speak to you this way love to you   
my ex husband be a narcissistwhen I confront he of every day issue like get health insurance for our baby when I find out I be highly pregnant he say we would pay cash when and if need to     I then realize he do not want child I spend   work with he to make our future   marry he give bih   divorce due to my ex be a narcissist I be recover from depressionanxiety due to I give up my life for my ex husband who be all about himself he have nothing to do with our child unless its cou order it may be himand not you
that be a crock shame on he he be not help you
I suffer from depression alsoi have anxiety pill with I all the timewe I take they whenever I need they apparently your husband do not understand how it work and his word be harsh even though we know your not a junkiei would have say to himyea I be a junkieso what and turn around and leave the room do not let it get to you do not let it keep go around and around in your brain take some deep breathslet it go and pray to god for answer
I lose my job due to my mental health so my husband walk out he say I be a lazy spong he do not understand what it be to feel so hopeless but I suppose I only have myself to worry about now
probably sound really dumb of I butare there class where the family member can go and learn about it so they can educate themselves a bit personally if I be the family member and have a mentally ill love one I would go to book store librarie the internet and educate myself on my love one mental illness study and write thing down when you truly love someone you would do anything to help they feel at ease you would love they suppo they listen to they and they will love you back love both way if someone love you they would not act this way I be so frustrated about they not want to educate themselves or find a book or something so so many do not bother that be not love I have full blow panicanxiety attack and take my med to calm I down I guess I be a junkie too a junkie be someone who be addicted or dependent on drug or med and can not stop sorry this have happen darling
he need to realize the difference between maintain mental illness with med and a junkie   someone that be mentally ill want to get well so they can maintain a quality of life and be as normal as possible and medication can help they do that while a junkie take pill and med to help they avoid deal with life you seek help and eat get more help that do not happen for someone that be fake it I be wonder if you talk to your doctor about maybe explain thing to he he need to realize that you need his understanding and suppo and negativity will not help you
hi I be put on zoloft mgs I feel they do not work that much but everyone be different   I do have alot of stress in my life atm which do not help
depend on your diagnosis I be diagnose bipolar   and mixed feature zoloft make I very irritable and bring out the rage of my bipolar my psychiatrist say zoloft for bipolar be a bad idea because it will flip you into a manic episode which it do
you mention bad thought many people with bipolar disorder   have psychosis at one time or another during their life they put you on an antipsychotic medication   usually temporarily even though it feel embarrass   take an antipsychotic medication it take away the bad thought   make I act normal again I realize the bad thought be not cause from my depression although it do make my depression bad the underlying because be psychosis its hard for bipolar people to keep regular sleep schedule lack of sleep can bring on psychosis
I have take ablify along with zoloft I have bern on zoloft about   mth and have no probe   previous to that I be on effexor and before that many other stae ablify due to paranoia compulsive self harm thought behaviour
my   y o be on that combo and it work for her bp and anxiety   she be be on it for many year   she be also a zoloft baby   as I take zoloft throughout my pregnancy because back then they deem it safe   same with my son   he be a zoloft baby too and he have be on zoloft now for his depression anxiety for almost a year
if you be bipolarnot a good med I be go to my daughter be recently prescribe it and she go into psychosisit be awful at just mgsshe have horrible withdrawal from zoloft too which surprise I because she be only on it for   week at the low   dose
I work in mental health care for   year and be very good at my job but between mental illness job stress and event in my life I be render a mess that can barely take care of himself yet alone other   I be disabled now   all I can advise be to get a suppo network of friend and family and get med and therapy and try to work through this   I have not lose hope that I will get back to where I use to be
it be not your fault and you be not stupid it be not your fault I work in an incredibly busy pharmacy and I know it do not come close to the stress of nursing but I manage to force they into schedule I only pa time and at night it be okay to work with anxiety and bipolar I have bipolar   and ptsd and anxiety disorder they say that work with these chronic condition be how we can get through they they be never go to go away and that be not our fault grant I do not do anything at all anything on my day off I just say alot of word but the real thing I want to say be it be not your fault hea
anxiety be a monster not sure what you do about it as I never find the answer and no one ever seem interested in treat that aspect of my illness they only want to focus on and treat the depression I wish you the good
I feel that way alot but I be sure my job be half as demand as be a nurse people do not understand what it take to get out of bed get in the car   get even to the edge of the driveway   the stress and anxiety the constant thinking go on in our head negativity and shame constantly   I understand everything you think   everything you feel you be not alone I wish I could stand up and say I can not work if they only know how I feel every day great job stand up for yourself   you be awesome
yes and like you I feel so stupid for allow myself to get in such a state of panic and dread around situation that other people find easy I have lose job and interview due to this in past and even socially I find it hard there be many technique but it be not easy to just suddenly become confident smiley individual take small step
sound like anxiety
such a fear of medication screw up ha can not even think of the right name for it smh bottom line be I could not live with huing or bad kill someone
yes I be a janitor at my kid school it slowly change into a para too then one of elementary school close and become a special education building   they want I to stay and have a couple of goffer to teach daily living skill ok no prob the staing of it be ok until it morph into   classroom of   spec ed high schooler the panic set in I do not have the skill or training for this other than my own two   the sit down plan do it come to find out one of the young man that be a goffer have a hea condition too and should have never be do some of the thing we be doingiep be not show to I until the sit down and his daily para be there push that be it I be do no way I could have live wmyself have something happen to he   I walk away from the school system miss the kid but not the stress or worry   I have not work in several yrs
yes   it happen to I   I always work full time   two job   single mom of the year   and then like a strike of lighteningit be like the flood gate open and my whole life fall into my lap at once   I have bipolar   ptsd anxiety   and borderline personality disorder   I staed medicine that seem to help then I lose my job because of my irrational behavior and tardiness that be last june   I literally go from be wonder woman to a she will of wonder woman   I still want all those thing job   money   social life   friend and family but I be crippled with irrational fear and anxiety I stay home with my kid now   I try to stay busy so I do not feel so wohless   I craft I force myself to make   phone call a day so that I be not completely alone   I try to make the good what be right here in my comfo zone
I cry over anything and everything   I think sometimes that I be way too emotional but then people who do not show any emotion kind of scare I
interesting point before I get treat I would list all the thing weigh on or annoy I what I learn be that it be hormonal and brain chemistry cause I do not discuss my chronic anxiety   or depression with most people I have a therapist to help I with that I do discuss my pain and exhaustion due to fibro because that disable I more visibly
if you be struggle and your people be just sit there watch you struggle they be not your people so be it
caregiver must be well in order to properly look after their love one seek the treatment you need and though it may be hard cast aside any guilt for seek treatment because there should be none you do not need your family consent or their approval to seek treatment force yourself to suck it up may make thing bad in the long run can not offer people something to drink if your pitcher be empty   do what you have to do for yourself for your wellbeing and for your future
pray ask god come into your   life its satan that be do th to you he s give you a horrible life god will heal what satan scumbag damage do it now you will have peace love contentment keepin you in prayer xox
go back to the hospital seem like everyone be focus on their well be you should do the same it be not be selfish or anything of that nature but how do they expect you to tend to your mom if you be unstable how do you think that you be able to so my family put pressure on I know I be not do very well almost like they tend to forget at time I honestly feel they do not care about anything but what they need or want and then I end up relapse I have learn how to distance myself from those type people to prevent have any setback every situation be different but if you be feel that bad I pray you find it in you to go seek help immediately god bless you and I hope all turn out well
exactly I fear not be on med it take many many year to find the right one but now I know how good I can be with the help of my med and counseling I never ever want to go back to depression
I take zoloft I be tell by my doctor not to stop even though I have horrible migraine I feel tired sleepy I do not see the energy she say I would have I do not like this medication and I do want to stop take it
I have depression and anxiety but okay I choose to deal with mine naturally medication be not a solution for everyone be my point and some thing be well manage   by vitamin exercise and whole food
I be really bad about not take my med after I sta feel well and every single time   week or month later I crash and burn for the past   month I have be take I med everyday like prescribe and I have not crash and I feel normal   what I think everyone else feel like I know well than to stop take they I know what would happen I do not know why I would do it   there be side effect of the med but I would rather deal with side effect than live without the medication and depression anxiety and mood swing
listen everyone be different how they be with thing with bipolar for genuine then you must take medication to stop this horrid horrid feeling and panic attack you get if you do not take they I have have the lot nightmare every night and disorientation when I never have med deep depression horrendous anxiety but when I find the right med I be feel great so do not sta throw these med away its dangerous if you feel ok without med well you have not get genuine bipolar or any genuine mental illness I follow what my psychiatrist say and never look back
I take all my med as prescribe sure they do not cure I however they do stablize my mood I be productive almost every day I still have day where I do not want to get out of bed other day I talk to fast or get irritable for the most pa my day be good   I do not think my med be a miracle cure they jut enhance my ability to enjoy life
medication do not feel fine medication make you want to go get a rope and go out the back yard its well to live with your insanity and not want to breathe   live with your demon be the less evil even though both be misery lol
have to breath slow and steady all day anxiety all day

anxiety and depression   be a killer
oh my gosh that be scary wish I could sta sleep regularly

I be embarrassed to admit this on mother day I fall asleep   do not even recall lie down I do not wake up till   pm we be suppose to have dinner etc I miss all of it nor do I call until I wake at   the bad pa be that I be   year old I absolutely feel like crap possibly ask your mom if she could teach your daughter to do these thing I be raise by a single mom as well it never occur to my brother to get my mom a card   gift once I take they out shop for she they get the hang of it I do feel for you though   it must really hu to not even get a   cent card on mother day
the most awful feeling be be estrange from your child and when you be bpdptsdanxietyocdadhd etc that feel without your family be magnify by x it be the bad feeling in the world you be not selfish you just feel more than other take your daughter to dinner tell her happy mother day without you she would not be here tell she you love she and just enjoy the moment do not matter what day it be you be still mredheam remember just as you suffer from these debilitate title so do our child they be hu by our hu and relationship be affect by the slight be patient and selfless time be on your side     happy mother day
no I feel the same way yesterday no acknowledgement no gift nothing it be a horrible day
I almost forget it be mother day personally I have no relationship with my own mother and my young son be enter his last week of his freshman year of high school my horse gash his forehead open my ap class staed I have serve on a major criminal case jury the week before last my old totally take over everything for I while I be stick at a couroom for   hour a day so we all forgot until my dad remind I saturday mother day be not a big deal to I my kid appreciate I every day of the year they have be know to give I father day card too in the past because I be a single mom and play both roll I do not hold one thoughtless moment against they much they be teenager teenager be notoriously selfish it be just how their brain be do not mean she do not love you or appreciate you yes your mom could have do something but she do not and why get upset about what could of would of should of it be really not woh the energy my ex never do crap for I on my bihday mother day any holiday and I spend a lot of time be miserable and let he ruin it we run into problem when we expect people to treat we the same way we treat they rather than accept that people do the good that they can do even when it be far from acceptable to we I have work hard to learn how to not rely on other for my happiness
I be astonish by this conversation I have no child by bih but   grow adult for whom I have be a special mom I be acknowledge weekly with love and appreciation for the contribution and nuuring I have give through the past   year I do not selfishly look for this it come as a result of build and sustain a strong relationship I have no anxiety over the issue whatsoever and personally feel you have blow this way out of perspective and be create your own malcontent experience
it be far from selfish hun its just the way you be feel at the moment and something so small that possibly would not bother you have become more prominent and it be upsetting maybe have a little word with your mum as to how it be make you feel I be sure she do not want to make you feel this way its good to talk hun xx
on my very first mother day after year of infeility my husband never even get I a card my son be a teenager now and it still hus I do not suffer from anxiety or depression back then so I do not think you be be selfish at all it be still hit or miss some year with hubbylast year nothing this year card gift and dinner it be not about the gift it be about feel love and appreciate we all want to feel that regardless of our mental health
I do not think your be selfish   maybe anxiety   over think too much about it   I be not say that in a nasty way to you   my kid be in their s   forgot mother day too but I have never encourage mother day   father day etc just another day for I   xx
its true and I lose that when my mumma pass away be a year and a half of struggle alone with no suppo and it suck
I be sorry it be the thing that bother we even though we feel like they should not    keep a very detailed journal for your therapist will help more than anything   it be so hard to say what you want to in the sho time you get    it be a difficult challenge to do and when it happen the distress make it hard to write or remember keep something on you at all time to document    I wish you the good
I feel the same way up until last year my dad take I to a krav maga class and I learn how to defend myself the first time I have to hit the other womans pad bag I break down in tear the instructor come over and encourage I to hit and keep hit I be sob the whole time but it really help now I know where to hit an attacker what will bring himher down quickly it be so empower that I be now able to leave the house I still get some anxiety when come home late from work but I remember what they teach I muscle memory and to immediately react if attack
I do this it be like I have a bubble around I that shrink what you need be a distraction the fear be not really your environment it be in your head
I move to pougal and for the first year I be too scared to go out alone as I do not speak pouguese now I can so feel much well I be so sorry you be have this problem but I can relate for year I be afraid of the night because that be when our grandfather would get drunk and chaos reign I be also afraid of teenaged boy for year due to harassment you be do the right thing by talk about your fear I hope you will be able to share with your dr hug
take what you have post on this thread already should give your dr or therapist enough information to be able to begin a treatment plan to help you overcome your fear of be alone   do you think you could possibly have a deep seat fear of abandonment   that be a disorder I have to deal with because of issue that stem from my childhood when my parent divorce   no matter which one of they be take care of methe other one be absent in my lifethis be what set I up to feel abandon when I be leave alone in my adult life   with the right treatment plan medication   learn how to cope I be able to overcome those desperate feeling of abandonment
as other have suggest if you feel uncomfoable verbalise thing then write it down infact what you have post be exactly what you should show your dr so that they can make a proper diagnosis or refer to specialist etc
I do not know but try search about paranoid personality disorder and maybe when you know more about it you can comfoably discuss it to your doctor or therapist
I suggest you write down everything that be go on everything that scare you how you feel well copy paste what you just post and hand it to your doctor he have to know so that he can help you with the right medication it work for I I have problem talk and I can not talk on the phone neither let your feeling flow on the paper it will work take care
if the doctor and therapist do not know they can not help   please let they know   my son can be alone but can not sleep in his room upstairs he be   he sleep on the couch to be near to we   but we can go overnight about twice a year and he say he be not scared have   dog that be what help he
I do this too write everything I be experience when I go to a psychiatrist the first time I hate med but I have a lot of thing wrong there be some that be out there and it would ease the anxiety I think after that your behavioral therapy would be easy that be my opinion like everyone seem to be say you need to open up to your psychiatrist or you be not go to get the right help you have suffer enough tell he everything and how it make you feel thought and prayer
you probably have severe anxiety and anxiety can come form anything high stress   or some childhood trama if therapy be go to work you need to be honest with your therapist in order for they to help you you need to be able to except there be a problem   in order for you to address it and get some cope strategy also there lot of defrient anxiety med   tracking trigger will make you feel more in control tell your family even as silly as you think it be they will suppo you and cope well try exercise an order to burn off extra energy from your body be kind with your self one step at a time

I just love when people say you have to be strongum let I see you live with this illness work raise kid alone deal with everyday life struggle cry your eye out almost on a daily endure tremendous emotional pain that get so bad it become physicaland still smile never tell a survivor of mental illness they need to be strongonly the strong can keep go and never give up no matter how much they have go through people live their life try to avoid feel uncomfoable or only understand grieve when they lose a love one or get divorce or any life tragedy people with mental illness get to know what that pain feel like alreadyand we still be try to survive warrior be what we areand to be a warrior and survive this illness take more strength than most can even wrap their mind around
I have get bad anxiety problem I be glad I have my girl she may not understand but she be always there for I redhea
  breathing technique show to reduce anxiety by    
I use mindfulness it have be a godsend there be plenty of resource on the internet explain what it be and what to do and there be even app for your phone a simple eg be colour it help you focus on one thing so you change your mindset like I say it be a simple example it be something you need to practice everyday so you be ready when your anxiety sta to take hold take care
if you have a generalized anxiety disorder it might not be possible to come up with a reason for the anxiety or anxiety attack I usually lose my hearing and most of my sight in a panic attack and I find the take an ice cube in each hand and squeeze method to be very effective   my psychologist tell I about it   just hold an ice cube in each hand tightly and it really help I think it cool you while slow something down and distract your mind with the sensation   once I sta to come back down to eah I sta repeat to myself you be here you be safe and push your foot into the floor and feel the sensation   look around and notice thing to remind you that you be safe in a safe place I use these they be simple and they work for help I gain back my faculty especially
I just learn this in order to identify your anxiety you have to know what feel your having and then figure out what feel make you have that one example have a great day find out both my teen have plan today I immediately go from happy to sad to angry to self destruct mode and in reality I be just truly hu I be tell it be a learn behavior which still I do not know from where I can see why I believe it come from a mix of be abuse and people be mean and eventually be take advantage of it be very frustrating I know and it just plane suck but if your able to do that it will help take I about   hour to see that and a lot of talk and distract myself will I remember for next time I hope so hope this help somewhat good of luck
deep breathing be the absolute good way to handle anxiety take a deep breath in through your mouth hold for   second then release slowly as if you be blow through a straw repeat multiple time you should also look up progressive muscle relaxation it be a very useful tool where you tighten pas of your body and release sound weird but be very credible and work
I have share this word so many time I will share it again if an incurable disease have invade your life refuse to let it touch your spirit your body can be severely afflict and you have a great struggle but if you keep trusting god love your spirit will remain strong
omg the struggle be real
I no the feeling it be horrible
your paner be insensitive and because you more stress than   need   I be in some unhealthy year shit   I fuckin dip no your woh
many people include I suffer from this and it be apparently pa of anxiety I google for it and a lot of link come up   I personally look at they as biochemical error and do not worry about they however I do seek and continue treatment for anxiety which make my life so much more pleasant other can not see your thought but I think you be suffer greatly from this problem and it be totally desirable and woh seek professional help you be not strange you be perfectly human
hello no I get more anxiety on this medication
hehecharlie brown actually calm my anxietyiguess he worry for I
if I do not have something to worry about my mind will definitely find something more to obsess about and then some
there be light at the end of the tunnel its a struggle but woh it   ask your doctor to change your med   I be on venlafaxine and stresam and all I can do be praise this wonderful combination   also meditation and cognitive behavioural therapy work for I too   perhaps try exercise too I take up golf   a great tiring walk with a purpose   good luck remember you have people who love you
you be not alone I have have some very dark low myself I have cptsd with anxiety major depressive disorder and repressed memory I have be to that dark numb place where everything that could harm you remind you of how much easy it would be but do not give up it may be that you be on a medication that do not work well for you or the dosing could be incorrect I go through a dark period for week feel like I just want to end it all I be numb and feel empty I do not have any real good suppo around I finally get back to my doctor who adjust my medication   and a few week later I staed to feel well it be not perfect fast and believe I I still have really bad day but you be not alone I be here if you ever need to talk
please feel free to express and even if you do not want to just do not do it pretend everything be okay be tough not only tough I think its just disgusting so stop it its you and only you who know how you feel what kind of chaos go on in you be mind I have spend almost   year in bed just like do nothing at that time only think I have be as if be go to pass away soon anytime hate everyone who try to symptahize or help I then there come something and I really do not know where it come from I mean the confidence that I can be normal again will smile again and it take year to that nothing be permanent you be in same situtaion like I the soon you want to get out of this shit the bad it get so be patient medicine do work but it take time meanwhile you well quit see normal people do not loose hope after all we all fall down and its not our fault you just need to stop worry about everything not only your illness but everything in you be life
iv be there be on citalapram for year also get propananol for panic attack I often wish I could have a heaache or something to get help it be hard to get people to understand how it feel I struggle with feeling about selfharm and suicide when I be low but there be another side I try my hard to tell myself tomorrow could be well or the next day fight it take care of yourself even if you have to be selfish the medication might help but   wks be probably not go to be long enough to notice any improvement I also find write thing down get it out you can read it later and see if you still feel the same or just bin it xxx
I have never admit it before to a group I suffer every day I be diagnose with manic depression back in   now they say it be a bipolar disorder I have get I do not know what the hell I have but it be hard as hell to go through each day I be a cutter I do the suicide attempt and gain a bad liver and kidney from it I have smoke weed and it help but I would slip into these funk and it be so hard to get through they especially when I be full of fear shame and self loathing during these time it be so hard to let people see I that way I have be struggle pretty badly today that be why I   happen on here it be a little easy know I be not alone everyone who post here remind I of myself in one way or another keeping focus on the small positive help sometimes   I hope you find strength and hope each day in little and large thing I always have to remind myself that I have control over my life thank you for share your story I understand how hard that probably be and how brave you be for reach out I do not know about everyone else on here but when my loved one watch I go through my episode I just want to hide or disappear send hope and good vibe
yeah I do not want the world outside to exist sometimes like I be trap in my own head it be hard to explain but   of my kid be still young   I find myself set they up with activity to keep they busy and hide in the shower   stall cry because I be so depressed and I can not snap out of it the doctor think I may have an ocd too and that feed my anxiety during my episode the feeling of no control add to the flame of depression and I spiral out of control other day it turn I listless those day I find someone to take care of the kid so they be not contaminate by I sometimes just see people happy make I depressed because even when I be happy I do not feel happy or it do not last sigh thank you for share a pa of you be world it really really help to know that other understand I even if my own family and suppo group do not truly understand my struggle
I agree with so much of what you be sayingi be diagnose bipolar year ago now l have far great problem with depression than maniastruggle to get up every day and totally hide away will not answer the ph or door push everyone away hate be see will not reach out or go to dr just inside try to distract myself with book puzzle film and feel totally wohless
it be go to get well your do everything you can right now   your go in the right directioni feel the same like you   I actually have   sucide and I cam back from all of they I happy now I get treat with the same med your taking if there not work ask for something ele if you do not do anything all day it ok you be do enough by survive try bath or massage I could not even leave my house because of my anxiety I pretend for a long time to be fine   therapy and meditation combo help
take a deep breath I have experience everything you have mention at one time or another make sure you stay in close contact with your dr   I live in constant fear that tomorrow would bring something that would cause I to give up   night be hard for I so I make I tell myself it will all be well in the morning I know it will never be well but concentrate on only make it till morning seem to be manageable
that you be reach out to we be amazingit be not that caring be not in you it be just that everything in you be fight to survive and you be exhaustedjust as this be terrify for you ist be for those who love you too so use what you have leave to not pull away from they go into hosp as a voluntary patient may be you answeryou can leave anytime it feel wrong and if it do work you will at last be able to let go and healallow any med   day then change if not workingbut ask for the side effect beacause we can be allergic and need to come off as fast as possiblei believe you can heal
I have be live with bipolar disorder chronic depression extreme anxiety adhd insomnia ocd bpd ptsd and self harm since I be   I be now about to turn   I have no memory of a normal life because I be bear this way and it show up early in my life I have be on every medication I have have unsuccessful ect I have be hospitalize a few time and see countless therapist and psychiatrist the side effect of med have almost drive I insane I use to be embarrassed about my mental illness but be try to become and advocate for it I be resistant to all treatment I have not find much of anything that help but I have see people get help and I have see people be able to cope with it be as honest as you can with the friend and family you do have I have be tear down by so many people I love but I be choose to be a warrior and fight this damn battle until one of we be dead it be scary because even as I write this I be suicidal and have a razor in my lap ready to make some more scar I know that sound not hopefully but it be mean to show I have a long way to go but look how far I have come everyday be different and a struggle and honestly just plain hell panic attack always feel like your die no matter how many you have medication can be helpful you just need to find the right combo for you specifically it be a challenge but hang in there see your psychiatrist regularly and keep a journal of how you feel everyday not just oh good or bad rate your anxiety from   and your depression etc then you can see what maybe be work and maybe what be not see a therapist often especially in the beginning talk about any and everything no matter how dumb or insignificant or embarrassing it might be you can learn some cope skill to help aid the med I believe in you you can do this if I can you can it seem to I the people with mental illness be strong they just need to find that strength within they hang in there recovery be a process not and event
and you know what every morning I wake up after   min my vision get terribly disturb I litreally see thing move where actually there be no movement at all but the only thing I know be one day it will be free of this shit

I be sorry you be go through so much turmoil I know it be awful it be definitely woh get well you can sta enjoy g thing again   and get a regular sleep schedule it will aso help with your desire to self harm that do not do any body any good if I be you I would go ahead and go to the hospital it really do help there be nothing to be afraid of or ashamed of the help be there for you take it before it be too late

I be cry I read this all the way through and I be where you be I be scared and so alone and I can not ever stick with treatment because I can not keep up with copay everything be way out of control I hope there be a life after where I be I cry from sta to finish and through comment
there be oh honey hang in there the road be hard but you be not alone I be here even with whatever distance be between we I understand that spot of fear and unknowe I live it for long than I think bearable you be so loved I be not just say this I really will be here for you message I if you need to vent let I hold your hand   
from the sound of it she live where I live and that will be no help   they may possibly give she   dose of an anti anxiety me and send she out unless you have attempt suicide you get close to nothing   they will call she med seeking and not help   I be not suicidal but want to harm my childrenwent in immediately to be hospitalize they put I in a hall on a bed for   hour in er then send I home because I be no danger to anyone and they could not waste a bed on I
I get free help at a state run facility while I be in utah I let slip that I be consider suicide a few year ago my mom see and get scared she call my university health center they call the cop the cop pay I a visit and go I in not the preferred route but I get the med I need and the only thing I be require to do be to go to a group therapy session once a week do not matter which one I just sign in and it count I would highly suggest go to the near depament of health and welfare and explain the situation it may take you a few day it may not to see a doctor but they will get you square away   do you have any family the kid can stay with in the area it might be well for they they will not get lose in the system you can see they whenever and they will not have to see you go through this there be also the possibility that during one of your drunken moment you hu one by accident I do not know if you be a mean drunk or not you have to ask yourself do you really wat you two precious little kid to see you do this to yourself
yes from all the comment here there be many thing you can do check with your state to see what mental health service they offer most will have free med for you and you can call their emergency number which be list on the state website   some state do use the first call for help line of    and hospital will help you will not lose your kid as long as you show you be get help social service may visit you in the hospital to see how you be do but that be ok as long as you have a stable and safe clean home they will not take your child most of the time they do not even get involve unless someone call to make a charge so do not worry
yep I be off my med for   month miserable and not functional to go see a new dr with no insurance be ridiculous
you will not lose you be kid if you get help that be absurd if anything it show you be take care of urself I live in the state as welli have be hospitalize a few time and still have my childthere be never a threat that I would not so please do not let that deter you from get help
she be the one who say she be afraid her kid would be take away so I assume the dad be not there and from what be write it seem she can have the med if she go to an appointment but she can not afford to go to the appointment ie no car or no gas money   which be why I suggest medical transpo   we have it in mi but I do t know about other state we also have your ride which be similar but you have to pay for it and it be like   buck
cut they off it be what I have to do with my family they know know more than I hospitalize twice in my teen and no one would tell I what be wrong choose instead to demonize I for use drug really do not want to see I without they know I be sick yet choose to judge I as a horrible person and dope fiend when I finally find out and that they know all along I cut they off I do not need they
I have except what I be my bad fear I see it in my kid and do not know what to do to help
colleen I will listen to you I have struggle for   year and girl I have survive you can too
and just to top it off I have lose all confidence in my gp who do not think I be bipolar how can I express how I feel when I have to judge people response before I even open my mouth well guess what I have not be able to   pull myself together   or give my head a wobble for over twenty year my world get small n small every day but I go on fight struggle along with something noone see
their life be not my obligation I owe they no debt I will say what I will if what I say hus you it be your obligation your duty to avoid I if you can not that be not on I that be say there be people that use it to garner attention or that do it as a fad I have meet plenty
I always feel well after I have do it feel like a release of pressure   not do it for a long time now I have my son to live for now I think those day be go for I now
I exercise hard now instead but no for I my self harm cutting and burning be cathaic it be the only way I know to reset my brain when it get overload with negative thought or I get stuck in my analytical loop it be how I staed breathing again mine be also hide on pas of the body that be not seenso yeah defo not for attentionbut I find work out or do yoga actually help the burn in my muscle help in the same way   but I be not bipolar I suffer major depression and anxiety
I use to do this for those reason rub the scare when I get upsetpromise I would not do it anymore
alcohol and drug will not only interfere with your antidepressant it be potentially very harmful to your unborn child   to be honest your post come across as be a bit blase you need to take to take some   responsibility depression and anxiety be not excuse for be aggressive towards other people have anyone mention anger management to try and find more positive way to deal with your emotion and anger do not know how old you be but you sound fairly young be you really ready to be responsible for another human being it do not sound as if you be paicularly as you be do thing that could harm your baby   seek suppo from your family friend or social service as you be go to need it however you also need to work towards well health it do not just happen by itself unfounately wish you good luck
I would recommend to see therapist   also maybe change your med also energy drink trigger anxiety and depressiondrinke with med wrosen your simton   it also think you might have bipolar   borderline personality disorder I be not a doctor or specialist but I be treat for over   year so I see ton of therapist and take natural   meditation as well as western medicineaccupunture work for I massage meditation I also stress level because change to your depression   not have a job allow more time to think try to keep busy if you can go for a walk take a bath juice fast my work too you can do day coconut oil reduce inflammation in the brain omega too help the brain function well ginger   like I say this be all the stuff that have work for I I be not a specialist try talk to a therapist sometimes when you voice the idea you have in your brain it lose it power writing   pick up a new hobby till you get your job do not worry on the thing you can not control do small progressive thing around the house stuff you can actually control do not rominate about stuff thing eventually work they self out   I have   suicide and I be revive from all of they I happy I be I have do a ton of wonderful thing and pick up a ton of hobby I get to see my daughter grow up your son need more then you think you can not replace a parent   one thing at a time   maybe the pressure of become a new parent might of trigger your depression but take your life be not the way out you need to see your son grow I be through   divorce and I have survive there be dark time but I keep do thing until I get well exercise have help I alot also I wish you luck and I hope I have help in any way have a mental illness be not the end of your life learn to except it and find new way to deal with it like any disease it be not the end all your life be just begin
sweetie get on different medication do your area offer anger management class or anxiety class
I know you be right I just worry about what they would think of I
what if your struggling and no one know how to help   when you wake up from a dead sleep feeling like you be   drown when people tell you how to fix your situation but you can not bring yourself to do it   for what ever reason   I be lose   I do not know what to do
you need to get help that deep of depression osnt something you can help he woth you need a pro but I agree with eveyone else if the threat be real you need to tell someone or get he to a hospital
I suffer from bipolar mdd ptsd psychosis and anxietypanic disorder I suffer since age   I try every medication out there I get so bad in october I do   round of ect   it be a life changer for I then it wear off so we try lithium and vraylar quetiapine and prozac and it bring I back up there be a treatment and medication out there it take time to find it I research alot myself and luckily my dr be listen to I and be willing to try new thing keep try never give up hope it take yrs to get to where I be at today
if he be threaten to take his life you need to call for help all threat of suicide should be take seriously
my husband also suffer from depression and to be honest I find that just be there next to he whether it be sit in the bed just read or be in the house as much as I can be a great comfo we be not all capable of express our feeling and at those time I just leave it until he be up to talk be bipolar myself I know how much I can give he before it affect I and I feel no guilt about it a weak I be go to be no good if he be weak too
if he be threaten to kill himself the threat should be take seriously   if he be get a therapist that person should be notify at the least   if he be on medication it may be fail and something new may be need   at the bad he may need to be hospitalize again which I be sure be not something either of they want to hear   if he be a danger to himself his health and welfare be more impoant than anything else   the poster may want to help their boyfriend but the truth be that they likely do not have the necessary skill set to do it and be too close to the problem   an inform professional might be able to give he a well perspective on thing   the boyfriend need to be talk to a therapist or need to be in the hospital right now if he be get this bad that be the only advice I have sadly

I have be able to skip the self harm lately very hard but still go thru the shamegrief from just having want to do it
I be selfdiagnose bpd and medically diagnose with bipolar ii social anxiety and major depression   I know I have bpd unfounately every time I try to be it up to my therapist and my psychiatrist they push it off as just my bipolar
it be a struggle daily not to self harm   I hope I make it through this day
all I ver hear be how crazy and psycho I be I just can not take it anymore after   year and many up and down we have decide to split up I know in my hea it be over I be so terrified I be go to fall into depression or mania which she predict and some other very harsh thing   I be just tired of the stigma and fall in it sometimes it suck thank for the rant
that person be most likely a narcissist and would find a way to make you look guiltybad regardless of your mental issue trust I on this narcissismsuck
I agree it be so damn irritate one person say yo I your med be make you mad really
it be hard I have be there many time if you have a good day you must be manic if you have a bad day you be depressed if you get mad or upset with someone for the way they treat you you be crazy and need to get your med in check I wish I know the answer
I use to have that problem but now I be on tygretol and wellbutrin and a new anti psychotic call sulfris not sure if I spelt that right and have have no weight gain issue there be no associate weight gain with any of those and they work very well my diagnosis go between bi polar and schizo effective with agoraphobia and high anxiety but those med seem to keep I very stable I be over lbs and yes I have help lose   of it but since then and the new med I have have no issue with weight gain
I take lithium olanzapine and miazapine for bipolar psychosis and anxiety yes they mean weight gain over the past   yrs I have manage to lose kg   not sure what that be in pound which be not a lot but it be still a loss I replace breakfast and lunch with diet shake in paicular optifast which I really like and I have a small dinner try to avoid carb if possible I have chronic pain as well so move be very painful but I manage to walk    min block   day a week to and from work and the train station I be lucky that I have no choice to walk if I want to work it be difficult and can be demotivate at time but it be possible take care
I be afraid to get one   what if I get tired of it I be so indecisive
oh yeah after my first miscarriage I spiral down a dark depression hole I have not be down in a long time almost destroy my relationship with my now husband I need to mother something so when I bring up get a kitten my husband jump on it and agree end up find a bond pair sibling we could not separate so they both come home with we they pull I out of that hole and save I and my relationship my boy be currently curl up on my hip as I type he s always near I and know when I be upset or sick and he take care of I
never say can not I struggle since a young age with schizoeffective disorder and borderline personality disorder be hospitalize many time and try to kill myself twice I receive healing and if I believe that I could not overcome this horrible deep darkest nightmare I probably would not be here today the struggle be real but there be hope
a daily struggle
identify specific worry work to change what you can leave what you can not change with god
the struggle r real prayer huggz n lovz with groovy vibe of peace joy hope n faith wrap up in group of kindness      peacesymbol
I be sorry that be not true and what be more the bible do not teach that and it will not back you god be merciful and kind and the book of proverb speak repeatedly of his understanding the bible show many who suffer from different illness and sense then many more plague people fuhermore the letter to the congregation and the apostle in the greek scripture share more detail of how we should console the depressed do not use the bible to crush the helpless I live in a family plague by this illness and trust I if it be all in the head fear god would have cure it a century ago you should stop talk and you be still quite ignorant
if society expectation and institutionalisation be not so limited we would not be suffer from these mental state we be not bear into this world to be train and teach how to live in only one acceptable state we be here for a purpose to share our natural positive gift that can not shine or enlighten we in a blinded high society that corrupt all that be natural and beautiful in ourselves and our beautiful world of abundance create to sustain we and all live thing instead we bow down to monarchy and legal chaos to survive not intune with the divine essence of our human race but the disgrace of hypocricy and unceainty of ourselves
do not think I be anxious anymore more fucking angry than anything else but now on med and feel calm and at time depressed
I can not even read it because of the red background   the contrast will trigger an anxiety attack if I force myself to read it
what other do or think can make we hesitate to take a stand until we realize god hold the now and future in his hand
I live in aust and work in this system    firstly get your key back   even if it mean police involvementmake your self safe   the unfounately until he actually hus himself or someone you can not do anything so gently with someone there for suppo tell he he can not come to your house make threat and treat you that way    because of his age and reguadless of his age you can not do anything unless you be his legal guardian   then he can not get a passpo without your signature    but it be a lot of legal stuff and   he need to agree unless deem unfit   but none of this will happen without he have an incident that call for legal interjection the law be very definitive for people with disability and mental health   if you be threaten again or frighten lock yourself in the car or go to a neighbour and call police this can initiate the process he need proper suppo from professional maybe even a stay in a locked facility because you can not force he to take med and even a group home be not go to help he in this state esp if he be violent    there be lot of rule in group home     you need to get the police involve have he section to a ward for evaluation for fear of your and community safety       it be really awful to go through but please put yourself first and be safe     
just remember the page you be on and the people who be give advice you be all he have and now the his mother have pass he be surely lose the trauma of lose she be most likely horrible for he as it be for you try to find this woman and explain the situation if you can   maybe just maybe she be ignorant of his disability
he definitely need professional care so hospitalization may be good he be clearly not capable of take care of himself and while it be good of you to worry and obviously try to help it be beyond your ability especially if he resos to violence put yourself in harm way to try to protect he be do no one any benefit
if you be worried about your physical safety he have your house key and all call the police and make a repo then call mental health service in whatever state you live in and the police repo will help fast track your brother to be see and evaluate can not imagine what you be go through but the outburst and threat physical violence be a priority in this situation
two point   do not bring he to america    a hospital stay can only help do not fear the unknown it be all trial and error
since he be   can you even commit he to hospital without his consent if he be not currently a threat to himself or other I would call someone for   legit advice hospital police if he be violent or let he make his own mistake maybe he will learn about himself and the world if he go to america
with his history he must be well know to service or have a case worker if you have contact number ring they as soon as you can he be your brother but he be not your responsibility it be never easy to do this he be vulnerable and need protection as much as you and your family do
you need to get he professional help he need it for himself and for the woman he threaten do not feel bad you will be do the good thing for he
yescall a hospital because he be a vulnerable adult he be mentally incapable to make such a risky plan he also need to get his his violent temper under control before he really hus themor maybe even kill they I know he be your brother and you love he but only tough love will help he   call hospital
you need help call for help do not feel guilty just do it and live your life protect your self and he call for help
I have a nephew like this he have throw stuff hit we his grandmother include wrap his hand around our throat till finally we have to literally choose do we want to live in fear of what he could or would do to we andor other after battle year and he physically attack a police officer the cous understand our plea and put he in a mental institution it be never the ideal situation
do not do nothing for I or my anxiety   mg   time a day I be sta to only use it once with my xanax when I have a bad panic attack just because
I believe this person be describe mindfulness it be a great tool in keep in the moment and not obsess about that which you can not control rather it be a means of acceptance of yourself and that in which you can change
I be on gabopentin for anxiety and it knock I out I sleep all night I have never be able to do that with any other med
I be on olanzapinezyprexa for psychosis mood stabilise and anxiety include anxiety induce insomnia I sleep petty well now the thing that be disturb my sleep be pain now but when that be under control I really do sleep well I also take lithium and miazapine I have bipolar and anxiety
have you consider   use cannabis for stress and anxiety
I have about   year of success with zyprexa for bipolar for anxiety for insomnia to some degree I black out for   hour during which I be say to be sleep then up and down almost every hour since go back on the ambien too mg of zyprexa be not touch my insomnia
zyprexa do not help I personally with sleep or anxiety I use ambien a few day then lunesta for sleep
I take ambien for about two year and it stae do that to I I too can not figure out what work for sleep I wish I know it be awful to have a horrible day and then lie in bed all night have panic attack good luck to you a low dose of xanax help I now but that also come with its own demon wish I could help you more but I be in the same boat
I suffer from bipolar and anxiety and I take lithium and quetiapine plus diazapam
do it not affect anxiety more though do it chill you out
my advice would be to seek advice from a professional read about different anti depressant and their possible side effect   dint think anyone who have respond to your question as refer to anti depressant which be what you be ask about many antidepressant be also good for   anxiety ocd etc too any drug have side effect range from minor to more severe and very common and rare sometimes you need to weigh up benefit of a drug against side effect and   accept thema long as they be not severe
zonisamide follow by lithium both be mood stabilizer with agent design to swat anxiety
I use olanzapine it be a mood stabiliser antipsychotic and it provide a calm from anxiety I be also on lithium and miazapine all   can cause weight gain so I be not sure which one or all to it but it have be the good for I outside medication I also use mindfulness it have be a godsend it be easy to do you practice while you be feel ok so when you sta to feel anxious you can use it check it out online you can even get app for your phone
thank sue I do not like to see guy treat people in an adverse way it get we all tar with same brush her guy have issue but she be not the because if anything he be the because of her anxiety    I hope she get suppo via this group who will put she in the right direction of realise her true woh once she accept how impoant she be she will be able to then choose who she share her life with and not feel she have to stay with a manipulative jerk because he have make she lose her own identity to suppo his      
your guy be a control freak and use what be know as projection technique make you feel everything be your fault he be incapable of thinking of you as he be a narcissist and want the world to revolve around he you need someone who will suppo you when you be low and share the bad time as well as the good and not lay the blame at your foot    you be woh more than he be but you need to show he this    tell he to take a hike and come back when he appreciate what your feel what depression and anxiety be and how low it make you feel once he have have a taste of you not care about he and concentrate on yourself it may teach he a serious life lesson if not your well off on your own    do not allow yourself your feeling or emotion be manipulate by a fool that do not suppo you    good luck  
my mom do this to I sometimes my paner and I choose to get marry abroad and she decide she do not want to come blame money but we have offer to pay for her flight and she find an excuse anyway two day before we be due to fly she ring I and say that I do not see what I be do that it be because I be bipolar and depress that I be not consider her feeling and we should essentially be do thing on her term it upset I massively thing be it be not I I have do everything to include she and she have refuse it be a means for she to try to gain control over I we go ahead with the wedding and do not let she stop I   you might love your paner lot but you have to ask yourself why he be do this be he try to control you too x
yup we make up be depress fearful manic so much fun we love mess with people staing fight be tell it be all in our head I be sorry if a doc diagnose we then they be not the one that be wrong but our family and friend that treat we like liar be
the problem with those with mental illness be they can easily be take advantage of and people can easily manipulate they make they feel like they be crazy at fault all that time because they refuse to take responsibility for their own action the gaslighting mention by alice sound a lot of what he be do if he refuse to see that you be I will and make an effo to get well and be suppoive I know this suck you do not need he it be not healthy for you to constantly struggle to be well so you do not lose a relationship that be not do well because your paner be manipulate you into feel bad   focus on you your health and mentality be all that matter right now not he
and it seem like her comment be gone talk herself up like she choose help and we do not I be a success story I be not a victim your opinion be your own I be go to continue to better myself say we be not try we sit in this group and play victim oh and we be insecure apparently she be all perfect now because she do not get mad lol and because she choose to love and have confidence she make I feel like a piece of shit well if she be all well she can leave she be a piece

I be pretty familiar with ssri meds if I have to guess this be probably more for anxiety or sedation medication I have be on seroquel before do not believe I be on the xr   as far as be worry because ssri do not agree with you this be not of the ssri medication
I do on on seroquel xr and celexa which be be anti depressant or just be not the right fit though and I keep have breakthrough episode mostly of hypomania and I have to stay on my antianxiety med but I try it for almost two year so it do not have any major side effect
I have be on that combo for about   year now it be honestly the only combo to work for I I have be on almost every med they make and be diagnose bipolar   when I be   I also have   child the seroquel xr be not for I it make I feel like I have restless leg syndrome I hope you find that it work as well for you

also if you be worried about drug interaction drug dot com have a great interaction checker I use it before put anything new in my mouth ever
in australia prescription medication be not allow to be adveise only the over the counter stuff it would annoy I use actor although a person with anxiety andor depression might be too anxious or depressed to actually do an ad what would be good be if they consult with people that be affect by the illness and maybe have people say what it be really like so be actor have a small understanding of what it be like
talk to she we be all different as for I I do not like to talk to my husband about it it be embarrassing so I just want he to leave I alone and give I space when I cry
just be understand my wife leave I about   month ago because she do not know how to handle my anxiety and depression because it be so hard to explain to she how badly it change who I be just be suppoive and listen if she be woh it to you keep fight and know she be not do it to upset you
let I first say that I think it be awesome that you be reach out to see how good to handle this situation and the love that show you have for your fiancee I have be with my husband for   year now marry for nine of they the good advice he would give be never minimize or make fun of the way she be feel something bipolar people in general feel thing more intensely people in the hypomanic bipolar   spectrum feel thing even more deeply we be prone to be more angry fearful and huful to those close to we in my case I would constantly question why anyone would want to be with I do not take this as a personal attack against you it be more indicative of how we feel about ourselves gently make sure she be take care of herselfmeds proper rest proper eating etc when I be in a depressive low my husband have to remind to shower read and educate yourself on the disorder trigger and symptom so you can help see if a cycle be happen even if she get angry with you do it anyway most impoantly remember that she be a person not a mental illness and that be who you fall in love with in the first place good luck to you both     
I have read a lot of post but I eventually cry over yours and I begin to feel sick to my stomach that I have nothing rightful to say to you in the moment so I shut my phone and run an errand get my composure back and I back and eventually return to you I think you have to call upon your son and open up write a list first of what be wrong and then give it to he to process you must give your son an open door to possibly collaborate to help you it would be absolutely cruel of you to take your life without give he a chance to earnestly help you he be your son he love you more than word ever do second there be people call life coach this tie in to you want to get back to your old self these folk have see it all nothing to be shy about try it you have get nothing to lose I do happen to believe that serious depression benefit from mood stabilizer since anti depressant can make thing way worse talk lithium zonisamide type drug with a sprinkling of antidepressant and force yourself to write down a list of what you know you enjoy even though you be not do it share it with your son and the life coach collectively you will gently come up with a plan no more talk of suicide or those thought for at least a month just barr they from have any power over you not an option I just give you a slew of thing to do my friend xxxx
emma peetz nelson med can not fix everything dear friend I have have these thought for year and when they seem overwhelming I seek more intense help it be what be some daysweeksmonth be well than other love you peet
I have very few friend and there be nothing wrong with that go for quality over quantity meet new people be not a problem trust they be so do not try to stop worry about other people if they really do not like you they will soon be out of your life but try to enjoy their company as they pass through it   some will stick around and will be willing to wait for you to open up in a few monthsyearswhatever you may actually feel different towards they and feel more trusting and secure   I know it be difficult I be go through this process myself but I be slowly give up a life of isolation for a life with a few acquaintance who may one day be friend and I be win as I be not so isolated any more still have no friend who I totally trust but maybe that will come but as I say I be already ahead by be able to join in with company sta with little step one after the other and see how far you can get
personally I would set an alarm if at all possible   set the title for the alarm as breakfast or remember to eat it be something I do on my day off work because I tend to get preoccupy and end up just have little to no food or fluid   set an alarm have work wonder and now I eat on or around the time the alarm be set naturally because I be so used to do it

heather marie awan a nice read crazy though I go to bed late and wake up early in a panic
karla kremer breister I to a t     bleh stupid anxiety
anxiety drain the life from you
serious therapy medication if that do not work and you still worry about be a danger to yourself or someone else hospitalization I be terrified of what that would mean but admit myself to the hospital save my life
glad to hear you be go back to therapy that be the first step you may also want to concider medication if you be not already they have help I a lot diagnose at   as well in the meantimeif you feel a mood swing take a step back remove yourself from the situation and breath slowly concentrate on your body limb by limb slowly and relax meditation can help too   it sound silly but it can work the self harm will be more tricky it help I to keep my hand busy during trigger situation I take up knitting crocet and draw it also help distract from the anxiety give you something manual to concentrate on

you be ill you know you be ill and be try to get help that in itself be difficult and very brave of you for the first time ever I have be in the same situation and to be honest I have feel shame but that be the illness shame because you and I have nothing to be ashamed about thing get so overwhelming and out of control and for I I self harm to change my focus because I be clearly not take care of myself and it force I to do that I be not sure what your reason be but change your focus be impoant but find a healthy way to do that be even more impoant especially find   something to keep your focus that you enjoy do a colour reading watch tv cooking for friend ask for help do not be afraid to ask for that I be not sure what relationship you have with your family but if you be close to they they will understand if not find other avenue of suppo you need to surround yourself with people who will stick with you and realize how difficult that level of control be or can be if you want they in your life write they a letter or sit down and talk to they tell they what you need and why tell they that you need they that you love they do that be all you can do and sometimes know that you atleast try be all you can do   focus on you and your health I wish the good for you and your struggle redhea

if your niece do not know about what have happen to you and what you be go through I can understand that she put herself first and be probably a bit hu that you be not go to her wedding   this say I do not think you should go to the wedding because if you be not upto be around your stepfather which be totally understandable you should not put yourself in such a position   ever especially not if you have a saying in it which in this case you do if you should feel guilty towards your niece you can still pay she a visit to wish her good luck if she do not appreciate the gesture that be her problem try to find at least one person who accept you for who you be where you can rely on and understand that you be not always upto be around people   it make a big difference if you have a person then you will not feel so alone you be wohy of have someone who you do not have to explain yourself to just be you should beis enough big hug to you

put yourself first I would not go if it trigger I this be one of those time you need to cut out the toxic people in your life if they can not understand what you re go through than you do not need they to bring you down either they respect your wish or they do not it may seem like alienation but you re try to survive with mental illness you can not control the way your mind be they will come back around when they realize you re try to make yourself well seek therapy and stay in it its hard for people like I with borderline to find a good therapist or stay in therapy I highly suggest dbt that s a good therapy for borderline we be our great enemy its okay to say no do not worry about please everyone your sanity will thank you for put you first those people have their own issue they need to work on themselves yoga help write in a journal help dbt help replace negative thinking with positive thought find positive quote online and write they down sta with one little thing that s positive and work on that you ll see a slow change
great advice I agree I be on my rd week of group dbt therapy and be hesitant at first but it be actually comfoe to know I be not alone and now with a care group of people not know her whole situation whether the niece know or not she may be try to show she care by insist for she be there maybe not know   if she know then she should definitely be more understanding if not it be good to know she care enough to want she there I know not be want be a bad feeling as well it be a shame abuser go unpunished in a perfect world she would be able to attend and that jerk would be ban sad
medication be only pa of the solution I have bipolar i and anxiety disorder I would strongly suggest see a psychologisttherapist while you be wait do some research on cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness they have be a godsend therapy along with the right med mean I can hold down a good full time job now I have my bad day and I tend to collapse on the weekend it I still feel I have a purpose medication can be a lot of trial and error it take I   mth to get the right combo also be careful of xanax you can either grow dependant on it or you can just get use to it so you need more to give you adequate relief chat to your dr about your med and therapy it can and do get well it just take time
I be on latuda but it levelef out after awhile I be off of it now I be bi polar too with anxiety and a touch of agoraphobia that be not want to leave your place I have to force myself to go place sometimes I be on lamictal and be on welbutrin busar for anxiety I still have not much energy but enough to go about my daily thing which alot be a regular routine all I know to do be tell my med dr about what be go on and whether you think your med be do you any good try n stay positive
I have autism spectrum disorder whatever that mean anymore I hardly talk to many people about it because the main symptom of it be adhd which everyone seem to have these day but the big one I be deal with right now be depression and anxiety that I have have for year and year

I be not ashamed of mine however I choose not to talk about it as openly as I have in the past because I believe it scare people   push they away learn that the hard way no true friend push everyone away I only have my immediate family now   I be completely fine with that they understand I   actually care someday I will have a friend who truly care until then I be good I will occasionally mention my mental illness but only to empathize with other so they know they be not alone I be I that be all I can be no more no less just perfectly I  
have a mental illness be a hell of a battle I have depression and anxiety
I understand completely I have depression and anxiety
especially when they avoid eye contact while be your paner   
for I it depend on the person textingcalle   I see the number or name and panic    most time I just do not answer    I have a few hard call to make in a couple of hour   be up all night worry
this be exactly why I avoid make phone call or any kind   I hate talk on the phone regardless of who it be I get super anxious
well do that be fantastic what you have do you should be proud of yourself that take some gut and courage x I understand what it be like it be awful I be lay awake now worry about tomorrow and I be on holiday it be my first night it be be a big worry for I to even come I have hope it would get well when I get here I be with some lovely friend we be tour scotland it should be exciting but it be not my anxiety be sore   like you say a manic day would be a lovely rest but then it would be spoil by the depression afterwards what a lovely life we lead hope you keep up the driving it be a big accomplishment x

underlie factor much of the decision to die be in the construing of event say kay redfield jamison professor of psychiatry at the johns hopkins university school of medicine she add most mind when healthy do not construe any event as devastating enough to warrant suicide eve k mocicki of the yous national institute of mental health note that many factorssome of they underlyingwork together to lead to suicidal behavior such underlying factor include mental and addictive disorder genetic makeup and brain chemistry let we consider some of they foremost among these factor be mental and addictive disorder such as depression bipolar mood disorder schizophrenia and alcohol or drug abuse research in both europe and the united states indicate that more than   percent of complete suicide be associate with such disorder in fact swedish researcher find that among man who be not diagnose with any disorder of that kind the suicide rate be   per   but among the depressed it jump to   per   and expe say that the factor lead to suicide be similar in eastern land still even the combination of depression with trigger event do not make suicide inevitable professor jamison who once attempt suicide herself say people seem to be able to bear or tolerate depression as long as there be the belief that thing will improve however she have find that as the cumulative despair become unbearable the ability of the mental system to restrain suicidal impulse gradually weaken she liken the situation to the way that the brake on a car be wear thin by constant stress it be vital to recognize such a trend because depression can be treat feeling of helplessness can be reverse when the underlying factor be deal with people may react differently to the heaache and stress that often trigger suicide some think that one genetic makeup may constitute an underlying factor in many suicide true gene play a role in determine one temperament and study reveal that some family line have more incident of suicide than other yet a genetic predisposition to suicide by no mean imply that suicide be inevitable say jamison brain chemistry too can be an underlying factor in the brain billion of neuron communicate electrochemically at the branchedout end of the nerve fiber there be small gap call synapsis across which neurotransmitter carry information chemically the level of one neurotransmitter serotonin may be involve in a person biological vulnerability to suicide the book inside the brain explain a low serotonin level     can dry up the wellspring of life happiness wither a person interest in his existence and increase the risk of depression and suicide the fact be however that nobody be destine to commit suicide million of people cope with heaache and stress it be the way the mind and the hea react to pressure that lead some to kill themselves not just the immediate triggering cause but the underlying factor must also be deal with so then what can be do to create a more positive outlook that will regenerate a measure of zest for life

no matter how much we want our family to understand what we go through they never will the only people who have true empathy for we be our fellow survivor I say survivor because we have to battle our brain on a daily basis but we survive maybe we go through this to be able to help one another I have be fight this battle for over yrs   my life be chaotic on the inside but it be still a life woh live most people fear what they do not understand and will lash out and we scare the hell out of they all you can say to they be that this be what I need to do to live my life your approval be not need but your help would be appreciate seek out a suppo group as a place to vent your daily problem feeling fear etc so you can see that you be not alone in this when we isolate ourselves and only use our family for suppo it will amplify the pain suicide usually happen in a moment of helplessness and darkness it suck at that moment but it will pass find something right now that you have a passion for it can be anything that make you feel happy and alive if you need to loose yourself in book movie video game search the internet hiking listen to music go out with a friend etc go for it just tell the illness that you need a break and delve into something you want to do it be a pa of you but not the only pa of you   just know that you be bear this way because your soul be strong and can find your way and all the people who comment be send you suppo acceptance of who you be and love for a fellow human being we care about you and the pain you be in we see you you be not alone

self harm do not generally mean that someone be hue themself in order to kill themselves   people who self harm generally do as a copy mechanism to deal with distress hu pain or to actually feel something it do not mean they be at the point of suicide   these be thing that can distract until the urge or compulsion to harm calm down rather than burn or cut yourself for instance and leave permanent damag or harm   it be to try and find something that do not because permanent damage such as ice cube draw on arm with red paint or excercise etc

I work in nonclinical job for our local hospital for   year I work   year long than my psychiatrist want I too I be now seek disability I have bipolar disorder ptsd general anxiety and on the physical side fibromyalgia I be out of work for about   month before I could really look back and see how stress out I be I believe I be close to a breakdown I have my disability hearing in july after be out of work   and a half year
I think you might need to try a less stressful environment with predictable patient and hour could you work in an office   like a physician office   or have you think   of apply for disability   it be not much money but after two year you get access to health care
even recovery   room   can be extremely   stressful some patient do not come out of anesthesia   well at all have screaming and violent   episode through no fault of their own
those can be very stressful environment do not suggest there
take a step down from right now think of be a school nurse less stressful
consider go that four hour you be more valuable than your illness it will work for you I have find in   year of depressionanxiety that the right doctor can make a huge difference do it
I run my family life cuz I carnt be on my own in the house or out cuz of panic attack c

no you do not ruin every thing that be you be depression and anxiety tell you that your family will not think that at all they sound like they want to suppo you so let they they love you and want the good for you it be very hard to see when you be not well you be very lucky to have a caring family embrace it and take strength from it when you be feel a bit well have a think about it think how you would react if it be a member of your family that have your illness you would probably want to be there for they it be difficult to see whilst you be   ill fighting the demon suck to live life out of you and you be unable to think rationally like you say you feel on burden on everyone you know but we be not take care I hope you have a good period soon listen to your family then x
this be your damaged mind say this not the true you   you want to live life and see your child grow but the illness make it difficult   try not to feel guilty or have shame over what your illness be do to you   just keep live life and seek help if you can   surround yourself with a suppo network and believe that one day you will pull through this dark cloud

manage to lose   st but extremely hard even with diet and exercise plus I   take mg of seraline   and other med it be a constant struggle
I be on both hydroxyzine and seroquel I do not really think the hydroxyzine help with anxiety it do make you sleepy and I can not sleep if I do not have the seroquel hope this help
hydroxyzineit be not a strong drug but work for anxiety serequil be hard core and hard to get off hydroxyzine be also use for itch basically it be a benadryl on steroid
hydroxyzine calm I but also put I to sleep it be fast act the seroquel I just store take because it have I the bad restless leg I have ever experience but as they have all say its different for everybody   all you can do be try it and find out
god not seraquil also name quitepin they hand they out in old people home to keep they quiet when you first take they you feel like you have be brainwash horrible nasty drug
seroquil scare I   I stop take it because it be make I sleep walk   freak I out
hi I have be on citalopram and seraline for severe clinical depression in the past neither add to the quality of life and between they the side effect be not good recently I have be make reundant and also threaten with homelessness all within a month my anxiety and depression be through the roof my gp suggest I try an snri instead of the usual ssri he put I on venlaflaxine for both anxiety and depression after   week I feel in a much well place and apa from a mild headache during the first week I have have no side effect at all and that include in the area of your life that ssris usually spoil   
I have take both seroquel cause I rapid excess weight gain   lb over   month vistaril hydroxyzine do not help with my anxiety
I be on seroquel have be for almost   year I love it it be a mood stabilizer and give for sleep I be on mg now but find that I wake up feeling refresh do not like the extend release because I feel like I have restless leg syndrome but the regular release work awesome before seroquel I would stay awake for week with no sleep in sight
hydroxyine vistaril be an antihistamine   use to treat allergic reaction nausea sickness and   tension and anxiety as it have sedative effect seroquel be an anti psychotic not an anti depressant and normally prescribe in addition to an anti depressant if person be suffer depression
oop do not mean to send that yet hydroxyzine work with my minor anxiety but not much else good luck
I have take seraquel for year and it help with my agitation I take it at night and sleep good now that my anxiety be well before I take trazdone for sleep it work great but as my anxiety improve it would make I tired
hydroxyzine work great for my panic attack and calm down my anxiety
hydroxyzine be amazing for pain or if you be go through withdrawal from drug or come down from drug and seroquil work for maybe   week for I I take it for sleep but then I staed get restless leg syndrome and muscle spasm would be up all night you also gain a lot of weight on seroquil so be careful

I suggest vipasanna meditation also know as mindfulness meditation for the reduction of anxiousness look up some scientific paper on the subject it work for I
I be an alcoholic which make treatment extremely hard I be diligent with my med but it be very hard stay sober and take med that do not seem to get I stable or drink that seem to make thing ok I make the choice horrible to do my med and it be work not say I do not want a drink but the benefit of just med have help I tremendously get a job do well got a car too I be do well but the drug be hard to fight I wish I could help   
it do take time to find the right therapist for you you have to be able to trust that person and be able to build a repore a relationship between the two of you sometimes it take a while to find that right one   there be patienttherapist confidentiality if you do anything to this guy stop sho of a felony you should not have to worry about it   I find it very helpful to write down my story   pour your mind and hea out on sheet of paper read it feel it know that it be you on those page   hold all your anxiety bottle up will do nothing but eat you from the inside out as it be now   it be ok to see a therapist once or twice and decide if you be comfoable or not they will not take it personally it take I several year to find the right therapist who have the right modality and approach to really set I free from my issue   it may take you some time to find the good fit but do not give up
I have try all the write it down and burn it bullshit I hide it for year and function for somewhere around yrs or so un til something else happen in my life all that happen be a fe diagnosis of ptsd even more med and extensive therapy and the thought of death on tbe daily please just go to therapy now get it out and move on with your life while your young do not end uplike I basically live in a x bedroom come out only to exercise your dog and go to doctor appt live a good life and do not end up with social anxiety because of some asshole from the past
I think you suffer from guilt and year of keep a secret to yourself I know exactly what you go through till this day I have not open up not even to my therapist   be also in my s and everyday be a try day its so difficult to exist   all the good today
it take I awhile before I meet people that I trust with some of the horrible abusive stuff I have deal with my main issue be I do not like be look at with pity when I need suppo you have take the first step by mention some thing here over time I find it become easy   I have forgive those who hu I realize it make I who I be I still deal with feeling of self hate but talk about some of what happen to people that be struggle like yourself be easy we be all hue in some way the good way to move forward be let it go by cry write about it type it in group like this it be not a sign of shame or weakness but strength
you will only deal with this when you be ready to not before then the only way around the anxiety be head on into it the decision need to be make as to which be go to hu you worse talk about it and be brutally honest with yourself and your counselor or let it continue to eat you up inside who care what the counselor think about it personally you be pay they for their professional advice but it help to find someone you feel comfoable with in the end you have nothing to lose by talk about it you be the one cause the anxiety to yourself not the event memorie only have the power that you give they and truly can not hu you take a leap of faith I have to and my life be so much well for it you can do it
it can take a while to learn to trust a counsellor what I find helpful be write everything down and take it to my session I have it to he to read and he would pull thing out for we to talk about it seem easy that way they be there to help we so there have to be some give and take oh and have you try mindfulness for anxiety there be plenty of resource on line plus app for your phone it teach you to focus your energy on anything but the anxious feeling look it up it have be s godsend for I take care
I go through a trauma in   and have to wait month before I could actually admit that something be wrong and then open up to mental health professional about what happen I have not tell anyone other than my current mental health nurse exactly what happen to the full extent   and it still haunt I even though I have be through emdr for ptsd   but I have convince myself over several year to be more open about how I be feel and how thing be affect I if you can find a good therapist or mental health nurse you trust and try to open up to they even if it be just a little bit at a time it be impoant to get thing off your chest so you do not hold on to all that stress and because horrible damage to yourself like stomach ulcer and cyst
I have a number of mental health issue sever one one I be not willing to admit publicly but I will say they impact my life greatly and the relationship I have I have sever anxiety amongst they how do I cope truth be sometimes I can not but I have a beautiful little boy who be face light up the moment he see I and run into my arm who say daddy   time an afternoon just because I have he that day just because his with I I live for that I fight all my problem for that I use my little one as my ground source whenever I get too bad I think if he or look through my picture of he remind myself life be not all bad they be be little thing that make it all woh while my son be mine what be yours
all that anxiety you be hold inside of you be a result of you not talk to someone let it out to a reputable therapist cry do not hold it in it be well than any medication trust I

it be horrible out h get with insurance   lose your job lose insurance   they just pass a bill where anyone with pre exist condition be deny insurance through government our it be so expensive we can not afford it   I be just pray
lexapro escitalopram have help I tremendously with both my dpression and anxiety I take   mg
lexapro work for I for   year and I think the only reason it stop work be because my life become more stressdul

I have be indoor over a year due to people and terrible anxiety I would rather someone throw a net over I and drag I out of here    
I be from australia and get free or heavily subsidise drs and subsidised medication I just can not believe that in this day and age in a st world country a person have to worry about withdrawal due to not be able to afford med it infuriate I I be so sorry this have happen
if your withdraw off all of these at the same time they you be go to be in for a hard time its not go to be pleasant and that be speak from experience I would recommend withdraw in a facility where you can be monitor as I have anxiety depression ptsd ocd bipolar   boardline personality disorder eatly onset psychosis as well as chronic pain fibromyalgia and I have do the withdrawl process in order to change med and when I want to have my son but in all honesty its not go to be pretty please do not do it alone
I lose health insurance recently too and it take call around to   different pharmacy to find pricing to where it be manageable for my   med without insurance I have do cold turkey off my med before and I do not recommend do it I be stupid and angry at the world and manic at the time and do not care until withdrawal come when it come to your med I would suggest that you see if you can get sample of seroquel if they still do they keep the lamictal and prozac if you can call around to different pharmacy and do a price comparison my doctor stress in my situation lamictal be impoant to stay on
as many have state take a deep breath pharmacy can get you in touch with company that will either get you sample or coupon for discount if you have a costco in your area they have the good discount program and good price   but check with your state mental health website it should give you link to the county where you can get free care it will take time to qualify for the aca your area or any state benefit   I have be where you be I have slog through the system and know what to do after   year of trial and error   it can be very frightening but do not go off your med   pm I and I would I happy to walk you through what need to be do hang in there
I refuse to get staed on therapy to lose it suddenly its a real threat to not have the coverage there be way to manage
call the drug company they quite often have a plan that will work for you if nothing else they will reduce the cost of your med then go to the state and stay there until someone listen to you withdrawal be horrible and if it get too bad head for the er their social worker usually have someone or something that will work for you god bless my friend I will be think of you
you need to find somewhere that you can detox safely especially from the klonopin I have a doctor abruptly take I off klonopin do not tell I that I could suffer seizure that could possibly kill I from this withdrawal and the withdrawal be absolutely horrible from what I understand the type of medication be one of the bad withdrawal almost
seroquel be go to be difficult for I I have withdrawl symptom for a couple of month I have horrible itching and have to take benedryl to take care of it klonopin you might be moody for awhile I do not recall withdrawl symptom off of lamictal same with prozac I do not recall because I be on that too many year ago but I remember I do not tirate off of it I be sorry you be have to face go off of your medication that just really stink
I have depression severe anxiety ptsd and major ocd I have not take any pill in over yrs and cannabis help I
you might struggle to sleep
yeah I just come off lyrica and sereque l do not want to scare you but it be horrible you can not not take your med you must see your dr they can bulk bill you and the chemist can set up an account for you just tell they your circumstance if not go to hospital maybe there be a social worker you could see if you go down hill you have to be treat good luck hun
I be on olanzapine be mg now   as well as lithium and miazapine all   can cause weight gain I have manage to put a halt and staing to lose some weight kg by replace breakfast and lunch with a diet shake and only carb   night a week otherwise protein and veg or salad it be tough and boring and yes I do cheat occasionally but it be all woh it because this be the first time I have feel like I be in control of my mood and anxiety
I do not know of anyone who have use it either however the psychiatrist I work with have see it quickly bring patient out of very deep depression from my understanding you do not run the risk of permanent memory loss with it either as see in electroconvulsive therapy another treatment option for resistant bipolar
I suffer from bipolar   I keep a write list of   thing I love when I be depressed I look at it and try to do one or two thing like have a cup of tea or light a candle play with the dog it do not make the depression disappear but for several minute I be engage in something else besides my own mental and emotional misery

breathe exercise when you become overwhelmed with anxiety your breathing can become more rapid and if you can control itslow it you will find yourself calm down some practice visualization to help fool your brain when you become overwhelmed with a situation example anxious on public transpoation while go to work you visualise yourself where ever you feel calm and with practice you can maintain that image easy
it be   really hard   and you r very brave I have to struggle everyday to get out of a house oh sweet I lot because of my anxiety so I do feel sorry for you just keep on battle all the good to you
weed can make anxiety worse and bring on panic attack go to your gp and tell they do not ask that you wish to be refer to the mental health and you then get medicate good luck and take care

I do breathing exercise ground exercise I be a rockhound so I take long walk look for aifact fossil etc anything to distract my brain from the anxiety

I have bipolar I and anxiety which do not respond to med I be introduce to mindfulness and I have never look back look it up on the internet and there be also app for your phone it be a way of refocus your thought of course if you can get to a psychologisttherapist then that would be great but try mindfulness it have be a godsend
yes animal help a great deal there be a product call valerian root you can get it at pharmacy and at gnc help I some maybe it would help you also try to talk about your feeling with other and try to sta a journal hope you get to feel well soon anxiety be horrific but it can be manage good luck and take care

if you have a good friend or family member ask they to so an appointment for you medication be the only thing in the end I be bipolar general anxiety disorder social phobia stress   how I cope initially be by training in cognitive behavioral therapy on a distance learning course   this show I technique to stop over thinking and how to handle dysfunctional thought   you can probably go on to you tube and google a session of cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety   the other thing I use a lot again find on you tube be guide meditation for anxiety or you can get a quick one for panic attack etc   although these cope method get I through for year I be just the happy most balanced I have ever be since be on medication   I still meditate and use cope technique and I do battle daily just on a less scale enable I to enjoy   I be not so quick as I be before but that be okay   good luck you can do it   one vital thing also before I go be learn to breathe properly   hug xx
get into a routine of exercise and weight training be extremely helpful no one around here prescribe actual anxiety medication anymore
I have bp level ii as well my wife keep tell I to get out and try to exercise of course with no luck since depression and stress tell I to just stay inside to be honest the only advice I can give be do not do anything if possible that could cause you to go into a mania since mania lead to depression at least for I and try to avoid any stimulant such as caffeine be you in school I know for I my online class really because I a ton of stress even though I make a mountain out of an ant hill oh and maybe you should try to find a self help website such as mood gym

I would add that there be thing that might help some of you like hold an icepack to your face a friend of mine try this and be really surprised it calm he down try   breathe in through your nose for a count of   out through the mouth on a count of   which be really hard I know but if you succeed I think it be impossible to remain in a fightflight mode humming might work for the same reason since it be only possible to hum while breathe out remind yourself that in a way you be cause this panic and so you can stop it you be in control I do not I you do this actively like oh let we have a panic attack please do not get I wrong there
I hate the fact that I know some of my trigger but can not avoid theml have to just keep up the exposure as I have be tell this be well than isolate myself in fear
last time I have a massive panic attack there be nothing around I to cause it my husband and I be watch disney movie on the couch and I be browse pintr for diabetic friendly recipe for dinner with my grandparent it be a nice quiet night the panic attack slam into for no reason my husband be sound asleep at the time but I be sure he hear the panic in my voice all I say be his name not even loud just normal volume which usually he wake up for nothing I could tap dance on his head and he would not wake up but he hear I say his name be instantly awake and get up I say I need he to hold I and instantly he be next to I hold I tight while I clung to he do not say a word til I staed to let go of the death grip I have on his shi which mean I be stae to calm down and then all he ask be what cause it I be grateful he will always help I and I can calm down just with he hold I
shakir
I have an anxiety attack today and not all of those work
this be contingent on what the the trigger of the panic attack be if there be one if the source of anxiety be cause by an exisite phobia there be an establishd and ingrain pattern that be very hard to turn around on the spot without medication I would say just do not diminish the person concern and hang in there till it be over
I battle depression and anxiety a day bipolar I have my good day and I have my bad day it be hard to battle mental disorder
I to suffer from manic depression   anxiety   please keep pass this around
I do not know if anyone else have mention this but I stress to everyone if it be urgent go to the hospital and there also hospital program that be outpatient program in ceain place it be not just inpatient that be offer so look up the close mental hospital also in those that be bipolar antidepressant can cause mania and fluoxetine be one also it have be show to cause rapid cycling in bipolar patient it also may affect adversely the development of the brain in young people as far as the hallucination psychosis can be pa of bipolar but not bipolar
she be experience psychosis let she dr know that you be in an emergency situation   that she be hallucinate   show sign of psychosis   I have an episode of psychosis about   year back have hallucination for the first time it be the scary thing I have experience unfounately I be tell   turn out to be true for I that once a person experience hallucination when in time of extreme stress anxiety etc I sta have mild hallucination at least now I can usually tell what be a hallucination   what be real I smell smoke sometimes I have hear a dog bark in my room but there be no dog hallucination be not only visual they need to do something about the hallucination I hallucinate my house be on fire it get to the point that they need to add an antipsychotic medication some example be abilify geodon zyprexa seraquel   many other most of these med because a lot of weight gain geodon have the least affect on weight   if you ever need advice or just someone to talk to please message I
eh do not worry about it clearly a good poion of people here at least the admin think there be a one size fit all solution pharmaceutical to mental health problem when of course that be a silly ridiculous notion that need to be squash out
you need to call her psych   tell they you need an emergency appt although I be in australia most psychs will keep time aside for emergency I know mine do because I have have my own appt delay due to an emergency also if you can not get she in early enough take she to your local er for immediate mental health unit evaluation in the meantime I do not want to frighten you but with the symptom you have describe she need immediate care do she have someone who can care for her   be with she all the time I truly hope you find the help you need as soon as possible
I can not fully relate however I be diagnose with anxiety and depression and after a year of be on the same med they stop work because I do not coordinate they with counselling which be apparently what I be suppose to do my med be switch now and I feel great again and now I be do counselling so I hope I can stay on the same one this time my point be after be on the same med for a year they be may have lose thi effect

read this give I anxiety it be all this to a t
lol I be afraid to keep read like yup damn another one
I be afraid of the hospice too but do what you get to
do not know that my experience be that it make I irrationally angry pretty much   of the time
hey if you be stae a mood swing I doubt it be the wellbutrin this fast it be actually a great antidepressant for bipolar disease   I bet you be just stae to swing the question be will it be the big mania swing or just a mixed state   I second denise and kristin if you need the hospital then just go back and tell they that person be a trigger for you and they will need to help you avoid that trigger
just because there be one person have a crisis do not mean that you can not go back there it will happen again and it could be you the next time you need to trust the doctor and go back welbutrin be ok but if it be send you into mania that be not ok a hospital stay can regulate your med to give you some stability   believe I I have be there during my last stay there be one woman who be not stable and she be all over the place I just avoid she when it get really bad the staff let we watch a movie in another room   so please do not let this get in the way of your health and wellbeing
yep be there latuda prazosin lurasidone and cannabis   no alcohol none not a drop   do everything within your power to keep a regular sleep schedule   life be not over but it will be different bipolar   mixedptsd military etc   my deep depression be in remission after ectlatuda   mania be still an issue but seem manageable most of the time now   hospital stay suck   I would not ever consider ect again but it do temporarily help   the memory loss that come with ect be horrible you can get through this just digin and holdon for life
the hospital be rarely like that it be scary when it happen though I sympathize with that I can relate to a lot of what you be say hang in there thing swing around eventually   
honey you do still have the option to go back to the hospital   just because you leave once with doctor okay do not mean you can not go back when and if you need to sometimes it be very helpful to be in the hospital for a bit I can imagine how hard and scary your time there be though   I have take wellbutrin before but it be be a while if you need to talk to someone like you feel free to private message I I will keep your aninimity
I look at your med but I do not see you on mood stabilizer you be yoyoe I avoid depression and mania via lithium and zonisamide and I take an atypical anti psychotic ziprasidone to shut my mind down from think at night and keep I awake anti depressant can make depression way bad and induce mania mood stabilizer do not do that I would seriously overhaul your regime
find a therapist I be bipolar   depression anxiety I be on buspar lithium latruda seraquil just stae seraquil world of difference in the last month hope you find something that make you feel well
keep try   never give up I be at a point where I be so scared to leave the house I would only go to the mailbox and straight back in the house I have to change my med about   time but I finally find a working combination   I still get the anixety attack but not every day
I remember my st time in a psych ward security guard be call twice to hold down patient to give they a shot and put they in the quiet observation room I be scared to death and add that onto my psychosis and eventually I be the one hold down and shoot in the backside and in a quiet room now I have great control of my own mental health and I be lucky enough to have the option of check in to a private facility before I get bad enough for shot and quiet room I have medication but the thing that really help I be see a psychologist yes we dig up some painful memory that have not deal with like child abuse and rape and a violent father but my psychologist teach I tool that I could use to take charge of my mental illness rather than have my illness control I if you can handle it give it a second chance if they want you to bring up stuff you do not feel safe do ask they about cbt and tool you can use to help you cope with this illness instead once you build up some trust perhaps then can you sta dig I have bipolar I and while I be not always stable like at the moment I feel depressed thank to chronic pain I think I be do ok it can happen you can learn to live with this and be in control it just take time and a lot of hard work take care and good luck
its a long arduous journey find the right med   hospital can be scary place too   look into genetic testing for what med will work well with your dna instead of wait week month   side effectswe see client   time per week   have each patient closely monitor every   week by their prescriber to keep you stable   avoid hospitalization good luck here be sum info to sta laterhttpblogdnagenotekcomblogdnagenotekcombidsalivadnaenablespharmacogenetictestingforpsychiatricmedication
I have be on wellbrutin as well and think I need it change I have have depression and anxiety all my life you just have to have faith and yes find another dr you can trust I know it be hard but do not ever give up it will get betterredhea
bi polar ii rapid cycling schizoaffective disorder generalize anxiety disorder with social and agro phobia increase anxiety symptom panic attack cause by phobia issue and ptsd attack ptsd stress anxiety and panic induce blackout and functional blackout I go through a wonderful pletra of med try to control the bulk of symptom and maintain consciousness and to figure out exactly what my diagnosis where it be not a pretty road and I be thankful that when I have give up on everything I have someone come into my life and inch and nudge I and build I up to go back and become my voice when I have no word to explain
I be also a suicide survivor I have so many year struggle with bipolardepression disorder I be so glad that you have interest that can make you happy I have yet to find mine and its be along long time since my diagnosis I have find thing to throw myself into but they never last at the moment it be an irrelevant job one of many I have have it be physical so I guess it be positive for now I also find therapy a must to work through our complicated mind I only recently find a therapist that I click with prior to she I spend year take the step but go no where as of today I be stick with the program even with therapy and med I believe I need more I recently inquire about group therapy I need need need to be around people like I and understand from experience I be so sick and tired of be sick and I can not afford to mess up or make anymore bad decision be anyone on this site from michigan I be all over the place I just mean to welcome you to this sitewelcome lol
same I do not really get angry though more like overwhelmed when it be really bad for I I feel like it also just suck the life out of everyone around I and I feel like such a monster that I want to run and hide from everyone the emptiness and depressed feeling can be so crazy when I get into that want to end it all state of mind it be not that I actually want to end it all I just wish my feeling and thought would silence themselves for once   
I think I have get a lot to talk about with my doctor dbt therapy or bipolar   I be so confused   
it be all manageable with dbt therapy but it take a lot of effo on the patient and a lot of time close family struggle to understand the illness that I struggle with every day if you be read this and realize it sound like you know you can fight it but it take a lot of work
this explain so much everything be about bipolardepressionanxiety I understand bpd go hand and foot with ptsd
jason borderline personality disorder bipolar depressionanxietyptsd all have some symptom which may seem the same this do not mean you necessarily have they also therapy can remove borderline and anxiety but not bipolar or ptsd but improve it immensely and how to deal with it
honestly I would ask she about it I have be through this and it be a nightmare anxiety and depression affect I as well and you can not just go on not know if it blow up in your face yeah it be go to hu but at least you be go to know why she be act that way I wish you luck and I hope you can stay strong this will pass
I have similar experience she and I be close for more than a year but that be itclose yes we know each other feel she admit she love I but she do not want to go fuher like commitment she tell I she have a boy who come to her house almost everyday and her parent seem to like he she be afraid to hu I if we be couple although we do not have official relationship but it still hu I I expect too much because it be hard sooooo hard to get a girl in a country which homophobic then she suddenly disappear no trace at all my hea be break so I think it be well for you to make it clear with your girl what do you want how do you feel about she at least you help yourself to get an answer about the relationship between you two I find it easy to go on or even to let she go after we open our mind and talk about it you need to say how you feel I date   girl yes I be a player once and most of they need ceanty about the feeling

there be no quick fix I be afraid and medication be not go to resolve all your issue I would also suggest see another specialist to confirm that all your diagnosis be correct if you genuinely do have all I would not imagine you would be able to function at all bipolar depression anxiety can all be help with medication but therapy impoant especially with depression anxiety and eat I g disorder to identify underlie because there be no specific med to treat bpd therapy be most beneficial but bpd can cause associate depression anxiety as above that can result can be treat autism not sure about but do not think so second opinion be my advice though
this sound like I   although I be diagnose with hypomania    I take latuda mg valium mg as need and mg neurontin as need    I do not get the agitation and irritability but still get depress   most day I be mildly depressed or just feel flat nothing   it be not pleasant
with the anxiety it concrn I how it effect the hea if I do not take something to slow my hea I think its get to ware out soon then later from over exaustion
cyclothymia be like hang out for the rest of your eternity in purgatory never go extremely up never go extremely down it cause high level of frustration and stress and anxiety and it suck

new med they say give up top three month to be fully effective however he should sta see some result within a few week I would suggest if his tension and such be high which be understandable maybe find thing that might take the edge off while he be adjust if he like the gym nature hike video game draw a hobby perhaps something to charge his focus from baby even for a moment might help
I have lose many friend I only really have one friend at the moment she use to be my occupational therapist and after treatment we become friend she be a friend like I have never have she would do anything for I my other friend turn their back on I for many reason   they could not handle my illness   they think my suicide attempt be just to get attention   they do not really care about I   I be put more energy into the relationship than they ever do I miss have other friend as I do not go out allot as I suffer with social anxiety and bipolar depression so it would be nice if I have more people to communicate with and feel suppoe by but at least I have my folk and my one friend you have to weigh it all out and go from there it definitely be not easy
first you talk about contribute to the conflict then you talk about be betray it be a little contradictory it be a little hard to give advice because it allow for too much speculation and assuming but this be my point of view I have ptsd anxiety and depression mental illness run in my family my young sister have the same issue but also have schizophrenia and borderline personality she be always use her illness as an excuse but she may not realize it I try to give she the benefit of the doubt but I have cut she out of my life she be abusive emotionally and physically   and believe that people should accept she just the way she be because that be how she be bear I personally think that she should take an assessment of how she be and quit expect people to put up with be hu because that be just who she be I be not say this case be like that but without more information   I can only go off my own experience it be not just about other accept you it be about you accept they as well do thing that push people away be self center and it may be time to take an internal inventory if you want to be a pa of life if you want love one around do not use your issus as an excuse to treat people poorly get on med get into therapy actually care about people instead of only focus on yourself and how you feel my husband and I have a lot of mental issue and fight constantly I know how you be feel please understand that I be not try to be a jerk just speak from the experience of someone who have absolutely zero friend

wow you be go through a lot be not you unfounately I do not know of a quick fix autism there be no cure as for your other disorder there may be medication that can help but they may sta to notice a difference in a few week up to   there be some anxiety med like ativan and xanax that can work straight away but most drs either do not like to prescribe it or only allow you to use it sho term because it be easy to overdose on it you can build a tolerance to it so you need it more and you can get addicted leave you with something else to deal with one of the good treatment for anxiety and depression be cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness which either a psychologist or therapist use you can look they up online there be a lot of example of thing to try paicularly mindfulness there be even app for your phone to help unfounately this be not a quick fix but they teach you tool that you need to practice everyday so you have they on board when you come up with a situation or feeling that make you uncomfoable or anxious I really wish I could give you well news somebody else here might have a different perspective I be just go on personal experience I have bipolar i and anxiety disorder and my nephew be on the autism spectrum take care

effexor cause a suicide attempt for I and the brain zap from withdraw from the medication be horrible this drug should be take off the market it only make thing bad in the end
no crap like this be not need not everyone need to get ofd it and those that do some end up back on it take what worka do not avoid a medication that may work because someone else have trouble I be on mg a day and come off it just fine twice

those be all common symptom of anxiety medication help many people exercise help boost medication ensure you eat good food and sleep enough help your body be healthy ask your doctor about medication ask your friend to exercise with you ask the people you live with to help make sure you eat properly and do not sleep all day practice   mindfulness help I move forward with my illness but it work well in conjunction with all of the thing I have list

jessica white you should definitely read up on the topic most of the aicle and study that I have read show a direct link between bipolar disorder and dementia apparently people with bipolar disorder have an increase risk of develop dementia I be diagnose bipolar   ocd ptsd wanxiety disorder and   adhd my brain be a mess lol all kid aside I have also read up on all the medication I be currently take and have take in the past medication I need to functionto keep myself alive well many of those medication have unfounately also be link to alzheimer and dementia with all this information I would have to conclude that both our illness and medication be slowly wear away at our mind our memory nothing can function at full speed forever without experience some so of wear and tear some so of damage even the good and fast computer eventually sta to slow sta to become overwhelmed with datum sta to stall become full stop take in new datum until eventually freeze up and deny you access to the datum you do have I think of the brain in the same way with bipolar disorder or anxiety for example come the whole mind race symptom our mind refuse to shut down it just do not stop just think of our mind as a computer suck right educate yourself do not fixate on it knowledge be power even if we only retain bit and piece lol
I be   as well    I wonder if my memory issue be relate to bipolar as well    but   with a history of alzheimer in my family I worry about that to   and when I say worry   I mean fixateto the point of exhaustion
it be drain   I find that exercise   eat properly and just not be afraid so speak your mind help a lot   I be a nurse and sometimes I feel like ill upset someone and the truth be I have learn that anxiety can be treat my simply just eliminate toxic people in your life and appreciate the positive people in your life   family   friend coworker and people you trust

meditation be help I with depression and anxiety
  read about neuroplasticity change your habit change your habit research about neuroplasticity and how you can rewire your brain unfounately there be no single method to get rid of depression I have try increase the intake of food that be high on antioxidant even try oil pull hahaha exercise meditate etc I have not try psychotherapy though as my main pdoc say I be not ready yet still on clonazepam for my anxiety and sleep problem what might work for you will not work on someone else so   it be more on experimentation when I be depress which be more often now I cry and let myself feel the pain and hollowness then I really think hard why I be sad why I feel that way most of the time I can not find the answer so   I be there cry for no apparent reason it be so ridiculous I find it funny sometimes I do not think about suicide but death sound invite sometimes

yes heather welch lol people do not realize that we make change by talk about thing openly and truthfully I be so tired of the cannabis shame I have not be able to do anything even leave my apament except once a week for therapy for   year since I have get prescribed cannabis for my pain depression anxiety etc guess what I go to the empire state building I have be able to go to eat at a restaurant among a few other thing I have not be able to do in a long time or at all before and guess what   it be all because of cannabis it annoy I so bad when people do not look at actual scientific evidence before make statement I feel like its a personal attack on I every time smh
legality be no reflection of morality   I be irritated by this as cannabis have save my life many time and be the only thing that have ever work   I prefer nature   at least I will not die
so then for those of we that do live where it be legalize for medicinal usage and that be all we use do that mean we be exclude from make suggestion or even speak about to anyone on here or perhaps even other who do   I think that be a bit unfair and it be an incorrect limitation put on the subjecttopic matter because there be some value and woh in medical cannabis and just to say why I boldly question the limitationi can not take the chemical medication anymore   plus year of do so as prescribe I now have brain damage due to professional medical treatment I have brain damage I also have brain deterioration I also have tardive diskenesia I gain health issue that be never there because of chemical medication my hea stop long enough to be declare legally dead but somehow I be still here so what about folk like I do I not have any valuable suggestion because the good suggestion I have with any valuable woh be medical cannabis I do not say just cannabis because that would be imply recreational use and that be not what it be about it may not be federally legal but accord the law of the state who have pass itit be legal my ceification say it be legal my medical cannabis i d card that be state regulate and must be renew and reevaluate yearly say it be legal the fact that I can sit on my porch and have a county sheriff on the other side of the driveway at someone else house see I sit on my porch smoke it and he smile nod his head say how be you get in his vehicle and drive away while I be still on my porch have a toke or twothat also saysit be legal so I do beg to differ on your statement that it be not legal and if you do not like my statement kick I out of the group why because the entire world should have a toke and chill out on cannabis it also help I focus it help my muscle and joint relax and have less tension I also have tourette syndrome I have have it all of my life it help my tic because it help I to relax stress exacerbate my tic even internal stress due to other health issue as well it help I to deal with severe ptsd issue otherwise I may hu someone because I have be trigger in a bad state   I do not want that nobody else do either help with my anxiety it calm I down well than an addictive chemical like adavan or xanax or a painkiller which only make I sick which exacerbate all of my health issue more I have so many more health issue than I can list here and so many environmental thing right down to the barometric pressure in the air and even that can be quite a task to deal with and manage through it help I sleep I have be diagnose with insomnia since I be a kid it help I to have an appetite I do not eat when I be stress problem be with my internal issue health issue and environmental issue that affect my internal issue and ultimately become a vicious circle right back out of I I have a toke or two I calm down and I get hungry I can not eat when I be stress or under stress I get sick and throw up everywhere how about migraines medical cannabis help with migraine do you understand what I be get at here if I continue to take the chemical medication having stop for my life in I would be deadwhy because of chemical medication that professional shove down my throat I be   year old and I feel so broken and incapablei would rather not be breathingat allbut I have people who depend on melike my kidsand my paner who be also disabled but I have take a toke or two and I be so much more pleasant an enlightened happy love care mood I enjoy my kid and their energy I enjoy my paner horrible humori can laugh instead of want to break down and bawl and wonder when the next big crash be come it might not be right for everyone but to exclude people from talk about it or even reference it because it be a worldwide page and it be not legal everywherewell that be no different than most of we have experience in our livesbeing exclude for this or that or the other thing oh excuse I while I eat an entire brownie and get some well need sleep and wake up feel okay instead of take a pill that make my hea race when I already have gain hea issue from those professional prescribe chemical several of which put I in the er have I not go to the er each of those timesmy hea would have beat itself to my death and explode in my chest so please tell I if the chemical medication do not work for I but medical cannabis do do that mean I have no valuable input do that mean I have nothing to contribute because it will be delete go ahead delete it delete I too I find the lack of ability to allow for inclusion be mighty sad you knowbee gay can get someone kill in other country it be outlaw in some other countriesshould I stop be gay where I live when I can do so legally and freely simply because it be outlaw in other country and not legal sorry I do not think so you know what else here in the stateswe drink cocacola as a soft drinkthey sell it as clean in other countriesyou can find it in the household clean sectionnot here you find it in the soda isle but far be it from I to say anythingwho be ii be a medical cannabis patient and I know nothingapparently
I have an emotional suppo dog he be my dog for   year then I get really depressed and so I notice he really help I when I do not feel to great he cuddle I lick my hand I know gross he just try to make I happy and it really help so I register he and he be train to sit come shake high five give kiss and go away already because of his age and work with he a lot I highly suggest it for anyone with depression or any anxiety he help I with both hope this help
my pit bull be my emotional suppo dog I be able to focus on she and not all my crazy worry when we be out together she be not register so we be limit on where we can go we do pharmacy drive thru starbuck sonic for her ice cream treat walk at the park and visit the pet store
I think it depend on where your depression be come from if your brain be not able to produce ceain hormoneschemical on its own a nice walk in the wood will not help medication be the only way to replace those thing then think of it like diabetes   if your body will not produce insulin on its own it will need help with that   if it be come from stress a trauma or something similar natural way like relexation technique talk therapy etc might help depend on how open your mind be to those thing
life inside a bipolar mindwe talk real closed group I help admin I love pot read great for ptsd anxiety and bipolar let we be real it be on the cover of freaking time magazine mainstream america be real
I agree with tara except   I avoid weight gain by change what I eat and walk a lot
in general in bipolar you take a mood stabilizer like lithium or tegretol or lamictal or a few other one   then they tailor the other med to where you be in a cycle and the anxiety that you be experience    yes clonazepam be for anxiety but be addictive so be careful with it   I just stae buspar which seem to be help my anxiety and be not addictive
I take klonopin for anxiety however I take a high dose than most although my dr keep close tab because it can be addictive I also take lithium lamictal seroquel and vraylar for the bipolar rapid cycling
firstly you have to be honest with your paner yes you be suppose to be honest anyway but who really show the ugly side in the beginning right I be not say tell the person on the first date but if you see it be go somewhere sit down and have the talk as we all know bipolar be hard to understand and people tend to take your mood personally I print out a lot of information for my husband but it be still hard for he to get that I be not angry or upset with he normal relationship can be difficult it be twice as difficult if you be bipolar I stick with my motto of if I have do my good to educate you and you still want to use my condition as a reason to leave do not let the door catch you on the way out hard work determination and patience be what it come to it be be   year and we be still strong so it can be do
sorry I dony understand anxiety
I wna talk but I be   embarrassed and I do not think that people wna hear my story cos everybody   get their own problem
I can not recommend mindfulness enough for anxiety it take practice and may not be a sho term fix if you be already anxious but when you have a moment where you can focus do some research on it it have be a god send for I I also keep a journal of my mood it give I some insight how my mood be and if they be stae to get out of control try to do thing that give you some control over an illness that try to take so much be a really big help if you can see trigger or pattern you say summer have be a trigger pattern then you might be able to do something different to try and help the situation all the good
sorry to hear this look into use therapeutic grade essential oil such as plant therapy or young living oil they help with a bunch of different thing anxiety sleep pain etc good luck
I be on all type the only thing that I have to stay away from be ativan it make I so tired that I be late for work anyone that know I know that since I have anxiety I fear be late so I get place an hour early that really screw I up I take xanax which be not the good but work the good for I I get a little tired but not near as bad as when I be on ativan but I would definitely try your option because everyone have different side effect from medicine good luck find something that work redhea
I be on   mg lithium for mania and   mg trazodone for sleepantidepressant daily and lorazepam name brand ativan as need for anxiety everybody be different what work for one will not always work for another also depend which end of the spectrum you fall into as to which combination of drug will work be patient tell your doctor what be happen as you get it soe out side effect will vary as well whatever you do do not stop take med once you be on they without talk to your doctor first it could make the situation bad good luck to you hope this help
my win combo be lithium olanzapine and miazapine I have bipolar i and anxiety disorder remember what work for one do not necessarily work for another and it may take time to find the right med it take I   mth of trial and error
top bipolar med be lithium some other be abilify seroquel   lamictal and saphrispersonal favorite a lot of anti psychotic like geodon be also prescribe for bipolar disorder if the depression be a main concern they may add on a med specific to depression such as zoloft or prozac clonazepam be also know an klonopin which be a benzodiazepine help anxiety almost immediately work wonder for sure
believe I I be not try to outdo you but when I be diagnose   it be easy to say what I do not have then it be to say what I do have white send I into early retirement    even the judge be surprised I do not break down soon because I have long work history at one job one of my disorder be a social disorder that be very devastating when I be around a lot of people and more so when I do not know they I do push myself to try to tolerate as long as I can when I go to town I only go once or twice a month sometimes a third but not very often because be around a lot of people send I into a anxiety panic attack then my blood pressure go out the roof yes mental disorder can kill if one be not careful because of the stress it put on one person but like the judge say he know that do not happen overnight and could not see how I last as long as I do   one of the other thing that happen I have a complete nervous breakdown and to close because of have two more when my therapist get I into a group she say I should have be hospitalize   but I do not have the money or insurance and be lay off from my job I do not blame my xbox for do it because I be not only a danger to myself but to other coworker that be be   year ago since able to hold a job since then I have not be able to work a regular job ever again   because of the anxiety panic attack this next pa be not for everyone   year ago I be face with a dilemma I do not know how my therapist work it out but all I have to use be my government insurance to pay for it but a year after I get out of the group home and my therapist at the time retire   with the new replacement I be be charge by the doctor therapist and nurse and also have to pay for my medication I could pay out of pocket and only cover two or maybe even three but not all because the insurance will only cover so much and the rest have to come out of my pocket that I do not have because ssdi do not pay a whole lot out so I have to come up with another solution to the problem with guidance of a doctor that I do not have to pay I we myself off the medication and sta use vitamin herb and oil that have work for I for the last   year   but like I say before this be not for ever one and just like the medication it be a trial and error before I could find the right combination that work for I so I suggest to anyone that be want to try this research it out first and talk to your physician about it before stae even though I be do selfmedication natural stuff one still have to be carefull because the wrong combination can be more devastating than the problem itself so research it out if you be think about and talk to your doctor too

all emergency service here in australia be very slow unless life threaten mental health be never a priority again unless life threaten well wish dale
good advice by all and nothing to be ashamed of but I can see why you might want to remain anonymous most people be very suppoive when I be diagnose
only a psychiatrist a dr who specialize in mental illness can diagnose you why do your friend think this do anyone else bipolar be nit just about have up and down mood there be two type of bp   which to be diagnose you need to have at least one full episode of mania behaviour bp involve a more rapid cycling of depression and hypomania mania involve behave recklessly put yourself in danger   lose inhibition think you be invincible have special power over spend extreme obssession paranoia hallucination but not all but main difference between mania and hypomania be that with mania the person lose their insight into what they be do   and believe it completely normal when its clear to other with hypomania the person be aware of their behaviour but unable to prevent the cycling   it be not usually as visibly   destructive   as mania can involve be really energetic ie stae something and then suddenly stop   anxious not sleep obssesse compulsive behaviour   but if you be concern you need to see a dr for a proper diagnosis
do not take the word of a friend as a diagnosis you must see a doctor for that nothing bad will happen you may not have bipolar but another mental illness or none at all please do not sit and worry about this see your doctor
that be the only way you will know for sure and be able to get the help you possibly need I be bipolar once I be diagnose I make more sense to myself go there be nothing to be afraid of
I be afraid nervous and aghhhgg       I have many what ifs
recently I be staed on effexor I also be on topamax welbutrin weird I know and buspar I also take prasozine or mini pan at night so for I this work but you can not just go off any med cold turkey without   have side effect that could be life threaten you be also the person who be ultimately go to be affect by the med so you should be the one who should have the most say in what go in your body be proactive get educate on all the drug the can treat our condition the information be out there on google print out the sheet on each drug know what have and have not work for you keep really good record for those time when you will not be able to think straight or when a love one will need to get your history if you get hospitalize   I have be in this boat since I be very young and back then there be no one for I even now it be extremely difficult to slogg through the mental health system I have be through hell and back again I be seriously consider stae a blog to talk about what I have be through in hope to sta a conversation about what to do and what not to do my boyfriend and I also want to sta a suicide suppo group there simply be anything out there for those of we who come back and now must find way to cope with what happen and keep the light burning

for anxiety be lorazepam ok   well take first the anxiety away and take a moodstabilisator olanzapine can help low dose
I be almost   and the same thing happen to I just   week ago I be diagnose bipolar   almost   year ago no matter what medication my doctor put I on it do not work or I have horrible side effect I go into a   week day hospital program new psychiatrist look into my history instantly think adhd sta treat I for that by day   I feel well than I have in almost   year that be say the depressionirritability be stae to come back I fully expect at my next appt with my regular psychiatrist she will be add an anti depressant adhd be never something I think I have despite   other family member have it include my son
each medicine can cause severe adverse effect for some   paxil make I almost suicidal   prozac and zoloft trigger mania rapid cycling after they would have to raise my dosage far higherhuge withdrawal fairly quickly from ssri I get brain zap and auditory hallucination   shadow when I do not keep in my system and find out the hard way also that one like wellbutrin be not ssri but dopamine so I have   ssri withdraw and zero help for mental health    after   year of med I have find that lamictal be a necessity and adjust anti depressant sometimes to very low dose when hypo mania   just monitor the depth of your low or side effect   and if that be happen   then absolutely do not stop with only   medicine   I hope that you know you be beautiful   courageous   and strong and reach out and talk with other that have same diagnosis also help we release a huge trigger many of be have guilt or shame that we make other live bad   or that anyone could not possibly have mood thought trait that we dobee hear by other that truly understand be such a way to just release a clogged brain   dontstoptalke   do not stay silent even just write thinga down and throw away and never read it again if you can not talk about anything   take care of yourself bornthisway
anxiety med can help you through this also I carry one of those lavender scented candle in my work bag the little one you can get at yankee candle take a few breath of that candle actually calm I a bit hang in there
first off good for you for recognize that this med be a horrible fit for you   however it be always good to call your psychiatristprescriber when you see such drastic and crippling change and they should listen and take you seriously and help you get off of it   if they do not time for a new doc   but if you be ever experience such crippling side effect especially thought of any so of harm to yourself or other you have to call and they have to listen and advise accordingly immediately not expect you to wait and suffer until your next appointment
do you have any medication to take for anxiety   maybe that might help in this circumstance
music do show to help singe as well I do so much well when I sing in a choir one thing I have discover be that silence be a horrible thing for I and music touch my soul
zoloft be not good   I have more restless and more huge crazy anxiety
hallucination be a tough on I hear voice all the time which I know be not real and that I should ignore I be on olanzapine to help with that as for anger have you try mindfulness it be use for anxiety but it help I to focus and breathe and for anger or anxiety to pass it might be with check out the web and there be app for your phone be careful hallucination and anger can be a sign of mania keep in regular contact with your therapist and see if you can get into your dr soon keep a journal of your mood feeling etc it will help when you take it to your appointment take care
I have a wonderful healthy son I be diagnose   year before we choose to vet pregnant I be very stable then I have a suppoive husband that help a lot during those time of major depression but because I have my boy it make it easy to keep push through also during pregnancy I consult very seriously with all my doctor about my med we all decide that it be safe for I to stay on they than risk an episode during pregnancy my son be bear with slight symptom of withdrawal but other wise completely healthy have be   fine since bih I fall like we make the right choice for our family
I have bipolar and a   year old son I have he before I be diagnose we decide to not have any more child because of my diagnosis we be afraid take med while pregnant would harm the baby and get off the med to have another baby would harm I I do have horrible postpaum depression with my son which lead to my diagnosis it have be a real challenge be there for he he do not understand why mommy get tired or sick all the time I be also worried about the genetic component he have already be diagnose with adhd and we fear he will be bipolar as well it be a tough decision consider carefully
I think there be an element of guilt ya carry because there be a chance and no its not ceain or what the future hold for you and they I have my kid before my diagnosis and after everything I have go through they be my world but I feel awful for what they have be through and have   go through because of I play heavy on my hea but there be no right answer just what you think be right for you
if you feel strongly about it then I feel you should just concentrate on yourself you do not need add pressure and also not just yourself to think about your be sensible and the right thing do what make you happy in life do not add the stress x
I have bpd depression anxiety and an eat disorder and I be not willing to get married nor have child I be still   but if I can not be stable all alone how can I ever have a stable relationship with a paner or child I will personally pass   however everyone be different and you got to choose what feel good for you redhea
I be just so unsure and insecure about have kid I be sure I would not have any problem take care of they and I be sure that they would mean the world to I but I do not want they to grow up face this illness I hate it I wish I be not sick   
this be a great question and one that show a lot of fore sight on your behalf and by extention a duty of care   to any potential child I struggle with that decision all the way through my child bearing year but could never grasp the concept of take care of somebody else when I can barely take care of myself it be not something you can back out of once it be do if you do not like it I never do have child but it be not because I be afraid to pass anything on but because I could not have give a child the care they need maybe something to think about
I be not diagnose until after I would had my child they be both fine and well adjust child   and   they know about my illness and I have always be honest with they about it I think the one good thing about have the illness be that of either of they have of inherit it from I then they would have be diagnose a lot soon than I be as we know the symptom and also as we have experience of it then they could be help and understand more nobody else in my family have this illness but I do not think that know I have it would have put I off from have they obviously I would have be concern about pass it on to they as I would not wish it on anyone but if you decide that you want child then this horrible illness should not stop you as there be no guarantee that they will get it whatever you decide in the long term I wish you all the good smilingface
it be hard have kid with bpd I also have a tbi ocd and gad but my manic and depressive stage be even hard with kid it can be do but sometimes it be overwhelming and you can not take most your med while pregnant so be careful there too
I have   child I be diagnose at age   do not take med while I be pregnant but life up until they be on and off my med never be really under control my son bad be diagnose with adhd I watch he closely afraid it be misdiagnose and he actually be also bipolar my daughter be wonderful no mental illness so far I know that without my child I would not be where I   today find decent be on med three year straight now we be very open about our mental illness and our feeling they have watch I struggle at time but have be there and understand what be go on when I cycle I have make sure they be educate about it I do not regret have they but when I have they I never take into consideration they could also be diagnose I be young and uneducated
I have bipolar   and I be pregnant with my th child my old two have mental health issue not bipolar however my   year old have rapid mood swing it can be pass down and I be always scared for that I would hate for my kid to ever feel how I have feel but I think my chance of they not get it be pretty good if they end up with it at least I have experience with it I be diagnose a year ago and three of my kid be    and   it be hard to parent when my mood be crazy but I try my hard

I be more scared of the mania and what it turn I into I live in fear of have another mania episode because I do not think I or my family can live through it all again
I too I have a problem with irritability when I be manic not fun at all
be treat for depression anxiety and bipolar for awhile now med and therapy have work until recently seem like med be work as well I switch to a new med and it be be well   both bipolar and bpd characteristic fit how I be
it be common to have multiple diagnosis until you get one that actually fit essentially if the treatment be work go with it I be diagnose with depression borderline then finally bipolar and anxiety once I get my final diagnosis my med and therapy help thing fall into place
I be bipolar this be semantic and everyone be too fucking sensitive about the word we choose I do not have bipolar it be not the flu it be not acne it be not something I can get rid of its not something that magically develop over the course of my life I be bear bipolar and I will be bipolar until the day I die I do not have anything except a bad case of irritation with sensitive little baby who be bother by I use the wrong word
interesting viewpoint   I always say that I be autistic because I do not believe that autism be a disease therefore I do not have it   my entire existence be define through my perception which be undoubtedly and thoroughly autistic I can totally see this viewpoint though   bpd probably feel more like a disease go by what people have say   I would not want to be define by something that sound so uncomfoable
o god yes I stae gain on zoloft keep gain on lexapro and do not stop until I stae wellbutrin I have gain almost   pound altogether it be horrible
effexor can give you adrenaline rush I be put on neulactal to stop they just get regular blood pressure check up
I do not realise this be to high a dose my psychiatrist do not say anything to I his even say I can take more if it continue not to work properly I have manic depression anxiety bipolar panick attack any small incident can have I feel really sad at time especially if someone be nasty to I as I be mentally abuse my whole life
I have read a few people who have say they take more than   mg and either they be mistaken or their dr be misprescribe bit worrying
tracie camm southan   cannabis can exacerbate symptom you must know what strain you be smoke but do not smoke it vaper or eat it much   healthy   I have brain shock come off effexor horrible stuff
I use to be on effexor   smoke a bit of cannabis to help anxiety but have a hea attack   quit since they change I to zoloft iv go from   kilo to   I do not know if its because I quit cannabis or because they put I on zoloft   I could not stay on effexor because it make you be hea beat very fast which I get tacky cardia already so could not take they anymore
most depression anxiety and bipolar medicine will increase your   weight
I have be on it for   year and love it I be still on the staer dose of   which work for I and be hypersensitive to medication I understand your apprehension give this one a try
you can get your med pre package   for morning noon evening and bed time it cost I   a month to have that and it make thing so less stressful
I do not recommend serequil way too may side effect effexor venlafaxine work great also really help with my severe anxiety I have no adverse reaction take it it help I
med will affect people in different way it be a great idea to keep a journal when you sta a new med to cha what be happen that way you can let your doctor know of any severe side effect and as I have state before google effexor and get all the info you can as well as all the info on all your med keep track of what have and have not work be very impoant as well as why you stop a medication I stae effexor in november and no one tell I about the night sweat   I also get a cool med dispenser from amazon that allow I to set up my med for the week but have individual container label for each day the container have little compament for morning noon evening and bedtime med I adjust it for when I need to take my med and set an alarm on my phone and it have work out perfect almost no miss med
have you think of other alternative medicine like cannabis I have depression and anxiety and it help keep I calm
good way I have find to remember to take my med be to get get a box with the ampm if need and to put a alarm on your phone something most people keep on they at all time now day that way when you get the alarm you remember to either take your med if you have not or check to see if you have and since you have the convienant box you know if you have or not
I have always have the bad side effect with any of the anti depressant I have be on the bad being suicidality and I have try they all my doctor have tell I if I want to try any more I would need to do it as an inpatient in the psychiatric ward something I be not keen on   as for remember to take medication if you set an alarm and have it at the same time every day eventually your body will trigger its own alarm good luck and send you lot of heal energy       
all medication have some kind of side effect but everyone be experience be different the medicine information leaflet will list all potential side effect accord to severity and how common they be remember any antidepressant will take a good few week to produce benefit as you gradually increase dosage I be on venlafaxine xl   check if that what you have be prescribe as xl mean it gradually release rather than all at once for many year with no issue but I be prescribe trazadone and have serious reaction to it and end up have breakdown and in hospital similar to what you describe but I that be very rare the withdrawal symptom of venlafaxine be brutal   even after missing one day dose   you will sta to feel dreadful so if you be not good at remember then venlafaxine be not ideal as it be good to try and take they at the same time each day you could put reminder on you mobile choose time when you always do something and include take your tablet
I be also on medication to be take twice a day the good method I have find to help I remember be to take they at the same time everyday I take mine at noon and midnight I take effexor   mg it do not help I it cause I to experience extreme anxiety and irritability these side effect be so severe that I almost lose my job hope this advice help
initially make I very tired but that wear off after a few week I stae out on mg then be increase to mg and then mg psychiatrist want to up they fuher as he state they work differently at a high dose but I be not so keen on that idea they do help my mood a little but not enough for I to keep take they I have very few side effect from they each person be different though so they be always woh try I struggle to remember to take my med as well so I so they out into a weekly pill organiser and keep they next to to the bed I drink a lot during the night so my pill be by be I keep my drink and that way I tend to remember they good luck x
cud she pm I just say I find effexor no good for anxiety bt wif quetiapine I find it work well at both
I always set an alarm on my phone plus my fiance remind I
I agree if you have a cell phone with an alarm app use that I have trouble remember my evening and night med so I have alarm set make it a lot easy also I have venlafaxine and it work well for I it be one of the well one for I but remember everyone be different
if you have a cell phone set the alarm on it to remind you to take your pill you can set several different alarm for each time necessary
share from a member can you please post this anonymously for I   good thing I ever do be get off venlafaxine under the guidance of a doctor   I be a lot like you agoraphobic and have to have someone with I at all time I have the paranoia about people look at I and judge I depression anxiety panic attack and ptsd   since change med in september I be back at tafe two day a week and think about go on a holiday I have improve so much I be like a new person   I get a new shrink and a new gp   I be now on   mg of seroquel quetiapine at night to help I sleep and take the chase out of I in low dose it be apparently great for anxiety and I be on mg of zoloft   I be on double that to begin with both but have since september halve it   I take a valium at night to because I have restless leg   I have be on med in the past that make I have suicidal thought   if it happen again tell someone as soon as possible   there be light at the end of the tunnel stay strong xx    year old and have suffer mental health issue since I be   if the op would like to get in touch I be willing to share my email
I have bpd and have be on venlfaxine   effexor for about yrs initially they help with my depression but I be not so sure now I have be want to come off they for a while but my dr advise the decrease will take at least mth to avoid withdrawal symptom   unfounately what work for one person do not necessarily work for another so even if I be to say venlfaxine be great for my anxiety they may not have the effect on you blessing  
for whatever reason I have to take the name brand of it effexor because I could not tolerate the generic it help with my fibromyalgia but not so much the anxiety or depression
it do help with the anxiety
the problem be that the two be link there be a number of mental illness which can lead to people drink and become dependent some mental illness include selfsabotage impulsivity and risky behaviour as symptom say people have a choice be true but you have to realise that not all people be weigh up the pro and con the way a healthy person do because they can not make their brain function that way not because they will not they be less capable of make the correct choice because of their mental illness if you have not resoe to selfmedicate great I do not self medicate I have self harm as a cope method though which be also a choice but also a symptom of my mental illness we need to see addiction as an illness because people can not get out of it on their own because addiction can lead to expensive illness cancer liver damage psychosis depend what a person be addict to and because illness can lead to addiction both self medicate with drink and drug and become addict to prescription med it fit between illness and therefore have to be consider an illness there need to be suppo for addict and   education to prevent addiction and suppo for the family of addict stigma stop people seek help it be no good ask people to stop stigmatise one illness if you be go to actively stigmatise another yes addict need to take some responsibility yes they because their family an indescribable amount of pain but we can not breed stigma we need to end stigma so that people seek help help which might benefit they and provide a well future for their family
that be the problem with addict   everything be about they   they take and they take and they take   then they write these bullshit letter as pa of their   step to apologize for what they have do   let I tell you something   that be for their benefit   not ours   we get plunge into this guilt trip bullshit like we be just suppose to forgive they because   their sorry    you want to make amend   how about replace all the propey you destroy   pay I back the money you owe I   so if your go to send I some bullshit letter that make you feel well put a check in and maybe I will believe you
I have not get a everything will work out story I do not have a relationship that be work and I do have kid before I get a diagnosis so get through everything have be tough but I will tell you how I feel because I suffer maintain relationship and I find the stress of they very hard   cope with first make sure you you be as happy within urself as you can be get to have inner peace and you can not sta nothing on messy foundation do thing you enjoy socialise with people so you can meet new people even join a date site if you feel confident to do so treat it more though as get to know new people and see how thing develop always take thing slow get   know people stop thing get   intense and attachment that can lead you   get upset if people can not be the right person for you I only speak up because though I do not know if I can ever have a stable relationship I do believe within my hea that the right person be out there for everyone it be just find it everyone break in some way and we all have our floor it be just find someone who can work with your
I be almost   be through several marriagesnot go to say how many most of which I be not medicate I have a   year old diagnose with bipolar and a   year old undiagnosedbut I know the sign I be not diagnose until after I have my boy I hate that I pass it on to my baby but I also would not take a million dollar for they I have be pretty stable for several year now but I be not go to lie it be be a long hard road I   hate my boy have to live through some of my bad time but they love I and   understand now that they be old but I still feel guilty for put they through it this be just my story everyone be different
I say just go out and date and not get serious do not date think you must find a person to marry just have fun and meet people you will soon find out who be understand kind care etc when you think you have find that person or person   introduce they to bipolar and if they ask question tell they the truth it be possible to date with bipolar and you can find somebody   be only young just do not go out there desperate to find someone go and have fun with it
thank you for post this question I have a bipolar disorder depression and anxiety I be   and find it hard to date let alone just be around people in general the guy I be currently see do not understand why at time I need the constant validation that we be in a good place or that at time I become too clingy my poor mind just feels break
I get sting with that one also he be emotionally abusive but it be my fault because of the bipolar and it drive he to be insecure
pa of this disease be to worry about thing that may never happen   ovehinke be a tough hurdle to get over   keep it in perspective and learn how to talk positive to yourself   encourage yourself   you can overcome those kind of thought be your own good friend
yes you need to find a compassionate understanding person there be those out there my boyfriend of   year still do not get all the mood swing but be understand enough to want to help do not be afraid of have kid too I have two beautiful teen girl and they have not exhibit any sign of bipolar disorder and if they do I will be here to help they with it also do not view yourself as break I tend to think of myself as just different and with a deficiency I tend to think of my pill as a vitamin for the brain but if you feel you be lovable and woh it then you will attract someone
be on lexipro do not think it do anything for I suppose to help I I think with obsessing
different for everyone for I with depression and anxiety I notice it be work after about a month on my depression honestly it may have be a slight contributor to my anxiety but to be fair my anxiety med be not help either not on it now but if my depression get bad I would be willing to try it again and for woman I do not know if common or not but my dr would have I increase dosage temporarily before cycle that month
I do not suffer from bp but a caretaker for a son that have it   also his old brother suffer from severe anxiety and depression   we have all   be on lexapro I take it just for anxiety and the old brother have say it save his life   I get nauseous very easily but it have not effect to one bit   but we have be tell ssris should not be give to people with bp
its different for everybody but lexipro make I sleep almost all day every day I have a headache and be dizzy but that be not why I sleep I physically just could not stay awake it be horrible it help with my depression in the sense that I do not care about anything because I be asleep I also gain weight and I be not sure how because I barely want to eat and only sleep I tell my dr I be do with it and want something else so he give I zoloft yeah that do nothing after about   month I stop take it now   year later I be on mg welbutrin twice a day and it work wonder for I everybody be different and what work for some will not work for other so just experiment with it but if you be have any bad   suicidal thought while on the med please tell your doctor or someone that can get you help
lexapro escitalopram be an ssri antidepressant that can also help associate anxiety like any medication it will take time to see full benefit as you increase dosage I would say about   month before full benefit sta to show and gradually your generally depression and anxiety should lessen its not a drug that will immediately reduce anxiety
lexapro do nothing for I in the end basically all the ssris do jack shit for I when I finally get to meet a proper doctor I switch straight over to quetiapine it work wonder for I and really help take a low dose when anxious unfounately for I it be not enough to hold I so now take lithium and quetiapine good luck every med work differently for each individual
it make I more depressed nauseated and restless leg real bad they switch I to celexa I have be on it   year now no problem I hope it work for you
take I only   day to get relief on it and sta get my life back I feel like I crave sweet a lot some restless leg but not anything that keep I up at night be on it over a decade everyone be so different the way we respond
I take lexapro for depression and buspar for anxiety lexapro make I tired so I take it at night
no side effect for I it help my depression not my anxiety though
I be on lexipro take about   week before I feel any difference my doctor say the minimum people should be on it be   month I plan to come off soon coz I have a horrible side effect of night sweat   saturated have to change nearly every night   
have bp ii I can honestly say that every med be different and not always easy to adjust too I hate lexepro I have horrible brain fuzz for the first week whenever you be try a new med patience be key the side effect wear off after a few day if they do not maybe it be not the right med for you there be not one combo of med that treat bp every treatment be as unique as the individual brain be treat what I can tolerate may not be tolerable for you but if after a week thing be not feel a little more manageable and after two week you be not adjust then call your doctor seriously sadly this illness be not a one size fit all it truly be trial and error until you find the right dosage that work for you mine be no anti depressant and a small dose of seroquel and a big dose of therapy and do not he work patience
you be right and its fuck upi be in a   year year relationship and sex be impoant for a healthy relationship and its a struggle to keep that pa I feel like I could live the rest of my life without it and I be only
do not notice it help at all dr switch I to celexa can not really say I feel that help either but I be bipolarptsdgadpanic attack as well so that might be why I be on other med as well sometimes wonder if any of they really work I have good day and bad day seem like it be just go to feel this way from now on not sure how I feel about that but that be my two cent and then some good of luck to you a good friend of mine swear by her lexapro and she have depression and mild anxiety
depression and anxiety it usually help my son be bipolar have depression and anxiety and he be never be anything but okay or not good on his med I just wish they could get the right combination
side effect for I be restless leg at night
get off of it be horrible
sad but true also avoid any type of confrontation
aj kline and severe anxiety
I do not I be a pretty responsible independent person without alarm
I be on mg and I feel a lot well but I do gain weight that get I down so I come off they be not good so put bk on they but now on mg still struggle with the weight but I can now function as a human being
I have be on mg at night for   year now it help with racing thought and I sleep very well when I feel mania come on I take mg in the day and it help I have gain weight but not excessive it do make you hungry I take the generic call dopaquel which be a little cheap I be also afraid to take it at first my phyciatrist prescribe it for I hope it work for you
do you have any trouble come off it I be desperate to get rid of it
I have sugar craving for about   day on that dose and now my appetite be back down I would not worry about weight gain if it help to balance you out if try    literally everything and save what I think be the bad seroquel   for last
they be both equally as impoant significant weight gain be bad for the hea in the long run I have severe ra   rheumatoid ahiritis as well as bipolar disorderra markedly increaes your risk of cardio vascular disease through various variable probably the inflammatory nature of the disease be the big risk bipolar in some study have also show a correlation with hea diseaseeither through the illness itself the med or bothi reckon both but it may be heavily link to the drug that because rapid   marked weight gainand associate type   diabete along with metabolic syndrome this be not an option for I give the fact I find it hard to push to do basic exercise never mind the intense exercise that would be need to combat and mitigate these effect therefore if this drug do indeed work for I once I be stabilise I will neverheless be request a slow taper off of it and then switch to another med if neededone that have much less risk of unatural weight gain and metaboluc disturbance give the very real risk potential of my physical illness this be just my personal view on this drug it be ceainly not mean to scare or be a decide factor for anyone else people should be able to research it for themselves and if they be then ok to go ahead with it they   be then in the good place to make an individual decision base on their own experience of side effectefficiency balance yet another reason that this drug may not be suitable for I in the long term be that it can raise the hormone prolactin which give the fact I have have bout of pcos in the past be not a good thing kind wish to all sometimes it be such a difficult and complicated road we have to travel live with this illness
I avoid people and conversation because of that
please try lithium oratate in small dose exercise   mediate avoid conflict rest good diet   and get into the word of god
this be not about be exhaust   it be that feel when you be so depressed you just do not want to life at all you know you accept     you will go on but damn this suck so fucking bad even when I be not deal with this shit I be think about it my life will be hell for month god please can I just sleep through it   it be that desperation that this be talk about I be there once and I will work a great deal to keep from be there again  
sleep be a natural response todepression and anxiety   do not feel guilty   just do it
usually I get a response and stuff be post it be not usually like that to be avoid but I notice a change over the weekend too I think admin also have disorder so maybe someone have an emergency

I hope so   nervous about this week and I have a bad cough
we be afraid to loose what little we have control over maybe just guess
because of my bipolar I be sarcastic and crude because I lack a filter I also lack empathy I do not care how I make other feeli also do not care how I come across my coworker know about my illness and no one be bother by I however if they be I would not carei stop worry about other view of I many year ago
I be the same I be not too bad at home but at work I find it really difficult and unbearable at time I do not have any friend at work I get on with people fine but not develop into a friendship I be sure most of my colleague think I be a miserable moody cow when in fact I be desperate to join in but my mind andoid be constantly go up and down   do not help be off sick several time over past few year sometimes I really wish I do not work but I k ow this epilepsy mot be good for I as I would just stay in the house
your comment give I relief to this aspect of anxiety and give I hope because I feel that although we feel pain from the social isolation we still persevere thank you for share and care this give I strength that do not necessarily come from my medication
I follow this page because my son have be diagnose bipolar   I be also about to turn   I have   kid and one stepdaughter   I have work for a big corporate maritime service company for   year I still have no idea what I want to do or be   I wonder when I will be a grow up I do not think this be just about be bipolar or depressed or anxious just pa of life try not to look for a pigeonhole to put yourself into just try to be kind to yourself and do what feel right and get you through the day   
thank you my question exactly I be almost   and still can not figure out the answer   it seem no one can answer I either people just keep tell I that I have the answer but seriously that be bullshit   excuse my profanity from what I have recently discover   be around people who suffer from   or people who be willing to admit they have a mental illness truly bring the most joy peace   self woh out of all of we I spend   day in an adult facility and feel the most alive and the most myself for the st and apparently the only time in my life   I be once again lose no drug no therapy no amount of money can compare to the unplugged no judgment   pure love you get amongst the diverse people who share our same life long struggle with mental illness of all type different yet the same  
I live in a   by   tiny home you can not put much in it and I be happy than most people who have everything god be my rock and help I with my bipolar because he help I take the focus off I my brain get confusedmy hear very bad when you ask god to help then read the bible for his answer to help youand pray for motivation and the desire to do what he purpose for youthen write down thought of your prayer each day and act on they you can see progressbutyou have to be willing to allow his helpif a person do not believe he exist then this will not work
prayer for you I have be say a prayer call deliverance sometimes it help I calm my mind if you want to try that pm I no pressure hug
find something or well yet someone who can make you laugh uncontrollably   especially at the most inappropriate thing   I know this seem odd or insane to some but it seem to work for bipolar    schizophrenia   bpd the bad that can happen be a mood change even if only for a little while   right
feel nothing be almost bad than feel depress I get scared more at the nothingness
people always tell I to volunteer guess what I do not want to bug off I have some thing I want to do like write a book about my bipolar past   yrs of alcohol   crack addiction and my life be a bear again christian but I do not know how to sta   and some other thing but I be stuck on my kitchen chair play on my phone avoid housework every day as it be
for I simply be content be my happy it be not easy but it be woh the struggle
wow that be a good one   I be sit here today bore depressed and lonely yet I have a ton of thing I need to do   but my depression and bipolar anxious mind be make I sick   I feel guilty for even think of have fun   or any and everything I want to do will turn into a catastrophe   buti be sober and I be not poraye any of the ugly symptom of bipolar like I do   year ago   with medication and counseling I be well   for that I be happy   now to get off my butt and do laundry lol
those admonition place so much unnecessary pressure on people   if a person do not already have mental illness the anxiety and personal second guessing they create be detrimental so if you do have mental illness those admonition be just that much more so   I take they with a grain of salt make the most of life look different for every person and I believe contentment which come in many form be preferable to the often elusive happiness   sometimes just get through the day be a huge success
I can relate to this plus the add worry that what if I do the wrong thingsandi
I be bipolar   as well as for mei usually only want to hu myself even when I be angry with other the only exception be if I feel my wife or any of my family for that matter be be threaten if you feel like you want to hu yourself or anyone else and you be not sure you can stop yourselfplease call law enforcement and cooperate with they if you let they know on the phone that you be bipolar and you think it be due to your med and that you be unarmedthey will treat you with compassion and sympathy I hope this helpsi be speak my opinion base on my experience
I have bipolar I severe with psychotic feature I have get so psychotic before that police have to get a switchblade knife out of my hand founately it be close or they might have shoot I I be so paranoid and think they be go to kill I it be terrible I seem to be do well on my med these day never miss a dose do not want to end up in jail again
no it do not mean yr dangerous how horrible to say that your more than likely be a danger to yourself than other end of
my answer might not be popular but yes it absolutely can you ceainly can not put everyone in a box thou depend on how the person have learn to manage their disorder   like if someone have a history of not take their med or be in denial of their disorder   each person be different but unfounately the mania be the irrational pa that follow no logic
depend what stage they be in and what their situation be I personally when elated be very irritable and have a sho fuse but in time you learn to control it more and more   
I do not have bipolar disorder but depression and social anxiety and ocd and I be the same I be not try to knock down any of your point I be just be suppoive
sound familiar but I be not bi polar just suffer from anxiety and depression
hey all I be a bit old and have be deal with this my whole life can I offer some insight   we need to accept that we be differentspecial people we be loner and leader innovator and dreamer we have be train by the capitalistic medium and our culture that we must live in a house with a mate and work and be productive and not make wave well let I tell you that that will never work for you and you need to give up that fantasy I decide to live alone and not involve myself in committedromantic relationship about about ten year ago I have never be as healthy and happy as I have be since then not have to worry about the pain you because a significant other with you mood swing and all the other bs that go with it be incredibly liberate I instead find joy and purpose through help other especially young people I have more friend than before I have boundary for my friendship to keep thing less emotional I now accept my craziness because it do not harm anyone when I be unhealthy I keep people at a distance when I be healthy I strengthen and create new tie as people grow old become more wise and mellow I believe they can learn to embrace their unique neurochemistry and figure out how to use it for good good luck to you all
have ptsdguilt   depression from see my wife dead body hea attack   I can associate
I have be deny my diagnosis but the more I read maybe its true because this be I an I do not even realize I be do it but its ok many people be very successful and that suffer it so I be not go to let this stop I from live I be socially unacceptable which I be not to worry because a lot of   what they   accept I do not want to be pa of its all mess up because people who know just sit back and watch that be wrong
push they love one away before they push I away and accuse they of not love I when guilt hit I real hard       
I be definitely guilty of push people away and sabotage relationship

I totally relate to what you be feel   there be no easy solution at least that I be aware of   I be still fight through a depression and anxiety that have leave I disabled   the good advice I can give you be to stay close to those few that understand and really try to build a suppo network that help lift you up when you can not walk on your own and try to believe that one day you be go to feel well
I have suffer with severe chronic depression for almost   year when I be at my low I feel exactly like this individual therapy group therapy and the right medication help I get out of that hole but it take almost   year before I could see any semblance of my old self every single day be still a struggle but at least I feel as though it be woh fight through   there be a few thing I remind myself of daily   I will never be the happy funny outgoing girl I use to be but that be okay because depression teach I how to empathize forgive and accept although I be lucky in many way do not diminish the impact my depression have on my life most people who make rude comment be just ignorant about mental illness not intentionally mean or huful be content can feel just as good or well than be happy   and the fact that I be still here after struggle with depression for so many year be proof of my strength   I wish you the good in your journey
I do not know who write this but I be not ashamed to admit I suffer from these same illness and struggle everyday of my life mental illness be real it be not a joke I have some of the   very same thought   everyday of my life and have for over   year just because we see someone smile on the outside do not mean that they be not hue on the   inside   do not be ashamed to ask for help whoever you may be

your not aloneredhea I have almost your exact diagnosisborderline anxiety n bipolar I struggle to take my med correctly for fear ill get toxicity from the lithiumi work now but its a strugglehang in there hun and if you need to vent just a click awaystay strongredhearedhearedhea
I have be diagnose with the same bipolar   and boarder line personality disorder I do not tell people I know about it as I be afraid they will stop be my friend

your not alone there be so many people struggle I have give up on help as unfounately I find the people I need help from be in the wrong profession and I walk out numerous time so so far I have find no one some day be so scary I do not no how I get through to see a new dawn one day at a time   I wish I could meet up with other
I be just now accept my diagnosis I be sad an ashamed I have waste my life to this
I would get anxiety from it I know it   and probably end up abuse it   it would keep I out of bed though that be for sure   not a good choice for I   I be on latuda neurontin valium and ambien   none of it be work very well   I be on the verge of lose it again
I would wean off the ambien and valium they increase your risk of alzheimer by percent they also affect sho term memory
I be take adderal and love it feel more awake focused just alive however it make I very anxious and I become severely manic after be on it for just a sho time I know it be not medication alone that make I manic seeing as how I be diagnose bipolar   and manic episode be just pa of illness however I experience a state of mania I have never experience while I be off of it
not good I go crazy on it self harm   time a day could not function properly my anxiety go through the roof x
I take ritaline its help but not for my anxiety that somethime kick in
no you should definitely not be staed on alprazolam straight of the bat xanax either my goodness these be serious medication unless your doctor be prescribe they in minute amount I would be very cautious even mg of either of these drug could be way too much for you to begin with   I have be on both of these at different stage the good of the two for anxiety be alprazolam for I
I think I be in   different discussion haha sorry but my anxiety be so bad I can not work drive associate with public etc my dr say I have to rely on clonazepam to get by for the rest of my life I have try everything nonnarcotic do not work for I our body be different
most anxiety medication be pretty tame nadine maybe chat to your gp before make any decision personally I can not live without my medication the quality of life just do not exist unless I be level
I be bit scare the take medication   for it
you take med for anxiety
never benzodiazepine   this be like drink   glass of wine every day without the benefit of wine not good for the brain longterm more then   day of benzo increase alzheimer risk by   percent
I self medicate for year use drug and alcohol to help slow I down then pick I up only to find out I be bipolor plus a few more diagnosis at the ripe old age of   yes it suck and I feel I waste so much of my life anyway buspar for anxiety have be my save grace I be a recover addict so so many drug mention just can not be prescribe for I mg x daily and I be good just think I would throw this in the mix for those with possible addiction issue have a great day  
yes you be definitely right clarissa anderson I have to try so many med to get my moodanxiety right it be a very hard struggle but you can overcome it
everyone react differently to medication what work for you might not work for other I be take clonazepam and react badly I be now on buspar seroquel xr zoloft and tegretol along with weekly counseling this combo have definitely be helpful I still struggle but its no where near as severe as before its be about   year since I have be hospitalize or have a suicide attempt   and it definitely help to have a good psychiatrist that you feel you can work with and understand your issue
to be flat out honest with you I use to cope with my anxiety with alcohol I do not know what be wrong with I I think the bad I go to the dr and he say it sound like anxiety and I be like ok he prescribe I med and I feel like a new person do not get I wrong I hate go to the dr and have to pay a lot for my prescription but it be woh it
pass be the same as clonazepam sorry have to research we be in different country but yes I take paxam mg x daily for anxiety keep in mind be it very addictive and withdrawal just do not miss your drs appt
no zeprexa will not kick the anxiety have you try busbar or hydroxyzine if your anxiety be as bad as mine like social anxiety phobia fear not want to leave the house due to you just plain freaking out you really need a benzodiazepine
yeah zeprexa be strong definitely but I take my med at night and it stabilize I through out the day along with my anxiety disorder I take clonazepam
I be sorry I know how you feel about have a hard time with a new dr I hate new doctor you never know if they suck or not and then I have an extensive medical history from a tbi and many new draft have the magical fix they want to test on I then the first time I admit I need psych help the medicine effect I poorly and the dr refuse to listen so I have to go to the er and once admit I have to beg and plead until I find a nurse who would let I call my husband and let he know what be go on and so my kid could come see I before I be admit it take forever to find the right everything for psych it be hard I have bpd ocd and gad sometimes I be hate myself as a mom too I have one with a mental illness that have be a struggle for he and I sometimes wonder if he have the early sign of bpd and I worry about my young one and I worry I pass my mental and physical crap on to they tbi be from a tumor it freaking suck when you want to die want help and help be not there just take it one moment at a time one moment you can do it
I be in sydney australia and your experience be all too familiar I present to er and I wait in their interview room for over   day only to be tell if I be ask for help I be not at risk of suicide I tell they not to do a home visit because I do not want to upset my father and well   day later they arrive on the doorstep on a day that I drag myself to work in the hope of try to drag myself out of my depression they tell my father everything break confidentiality and tell he I be an attention seeker year later I call again because my psychiatrist be overseas for   week and I be tell if I could afford psychiatrist I do not need the public system and that be it I be now lucky to have a bipolar I diagnosis I be medicate correctly and I be able to hold down a job which mean I can afford private health insurance mean I be cover for a psych unit people say our system be great and sure everyone be cover but there be not enough resource to go around and the people run they do not have a clue I really do not know what to say except I have some understand my suggestion be to find a new dr if you can I understand your social phobia may stop that what about a dr that visit your home we have those in sydney also ring the acute care again and say that you need to have a case worker and a referral to a psychologist they might be happy to transfer you to case management get you off their book I really hope you can get some help soon you be do the good you can and that be all kid need to know
there be if you do not even know what dbt be andor have never be to dbt or be just recently diagnose there be a lot of factor your comment be not helpful I have no idea what the hell be even wrong until a year ago because I be only diagnose with anxiety and depression and do not even know what bpd be until after a   day stay in the psych ward and a meeting with my psychiatrist I have not get to sta dbt yet but I have look some of the skill up and I be try not every therapist or psych dr tell their patient about dbt though maybe think before you speak
hhahahha terkejut sekejap I bila memuler bukak gambar dia scary tapi really meh I can not relate ahhaha
I can not really comment as it be different here in uk   you can not just check yourself into hospital you really need to be ill and having be an inpatient many time often for long period it be not a good environment but if you feel you really struggle and really not cope with daily life if go into hospital be an option you should not be ashamed or as if you let people down   care for yourself
when my psychologist suggest I should go to a clinic for bipolar depression and anxiety I be sceptical at first but thing just get bad for I to the point where I would impulsively think of way to kill myself but I go and it be the good thing I ever do you have to do it for yourself because you can not be a good mother for your kid if you do not child be resilient   they bounce back quick than you thinkbee sick be not your fault and you need to get to grip with that and you will get   the assistance and proper medication you need to live a full life I be ashamed about my sickness until I realise it be not my fault today I have the courage to tell people about my sickness and it do not bother they as much as I think it would they be more surprised and want to know more about it
I have a host of issue and on top of that I become suicidal at time more frequent than I use to be that say no I do not go to the hospital because I be afraid of they and last time the police make I go to the hospitali spend the day on a stretcher in the main hall with everyone go by I and stare at the cry lady with deep cut on her arm and wrist no phone no way of try to calm myself down and refocus my mind i d rather die first before go back there I feel like a humiliate criminal for have a screw up head
I have be inpatient I will tell you this speak to your doctor first they will want to know where you be mentally there be no shame go inpatient you have to take care of yourself to be able to take care of your family my medication be what cause my issue a change to my medication and I be get well it be still be a long ride to find a proper mix of medicine   if you be not feel ok and be a danger to yourself or other do not hesitate to call your doctor or go to the er
go inpatient can be a really good thing I be not ashamed to say I have check myself in several time if nothing else it give a break from the day to day building of the real world    day rest from everything can give you the chance to recharge and refuel
go you have probably do for everyone else its time to take care of you I be admit last year after my own struggle it be the good thing I ever do for myself use the oppounity to learn about yourself and let someone take care of you do not let stigma stop you from get help you may desperately need
get help they need their momma   I be fearful of help till I realize how bad I need it then I get help and do alot well  
if you be not feel ok and feel like you be in need of help to the point of consider hospitalization I recommend do it I spend a while research place to go and during that hesitation I do something that land myself there anyway I would say go there be a chance you will not be as lucky as I be
I take seraline which cover both depression and anxiety can not imagine be without half med though xx
hang in there the trial of attempt to find the right medication be a long and annoying but once your doctor and you have find the right combination its woh it I have be seek for over a year and only now be I get close but it be woh the struggle
if you be frightened of hue yourself go to an emergency room do not give up get help call   if you have to its ok you willl be all right you be love you be woh it
citalopram also call celexa be an antidepressant and can also help with ocd and anxiety any antipressant be hope to take a good few week before you feel any benefit it can be increase to recommend maximan daily dose of mg any medication can have side effect which you should find list on the information leaflet   however if you be show symptom of psychosis or bipolar disorder for instance these need to be diagnose by a psychiatrist again if you not in uk system will be different
I be diagnose major depression with psychosis in     five year I get seroquel mg every night and it ruin my period the psychiatrist tell I that I do not need med any long    but a year after that I have become anxious and suspicious towards other I believe that other people will hu I leave I take advantage of I betray I backtabbe I sometimes I talk gibberish can not even make proper coherent sentence acuse anyone else for create such a plot to humiliate I throw   smash thing   this april   I be take to a new psychiatrist because I be unable to live a day without be angry and suspicious she give I new med   merlopamregistere   lorazepam mg abilifyregistere   aripiprazole   mg arkineregistere trihexyphenidyl hcl mg   which I must drink at night before I sleep because the pill make I lose coordination between my mind and body I can not walk or move in balance until the effect be wear off    to be honest I hate take med I be so sick of meds pill capsule syrup I use to drink med since I be   year old for physical illness and now I have to take med for my mental illness it be like I spend the most year to take med but I have to admit   I need it it be hard for I to simply admit that I need professional help well drink med than get electro convulsive therapy ect once every   day like when I be hospitalize in   but when I do admit that I need help everything seem to work in the right path    I have just be take new three med I mention above for three day it be hard to get back to the routine   drinking med after a year free of med I think I could survive without med but the recent problematic event have make I depressed again so I have to admit it   I need help I need med I need psychotherapy I hope these will help I hope someday I will recover and I wish you all the good too    for now I simply think this way   if I want to survive without kill myself I must take these med because my family and friend love I because they do not want to lose I I do this for they I do this for I too because I want to save myself   voila I succeed drink med yeay maybe now the med have not show any progress just yet but someday they would med for mental illness need at least   month before I really feel the good effect so I will keep drink these until I feel well and I must believe that these pill will make I well it take time but it be woh it someday and somehow
I just staed citalopram too it take time but most of the side effect should subside make sure to avoid alcohol and caffeine
I be all new to this toobut yeah I feel like this a lot of the timei always question if my family love I care for I etcit be a horrible feeling really it isi be on different medication and lately my mood have be good very goodi have feel content so at the moment I would say I be on the right dosethe tablet you be on make I feel sick alsoand yeah they do sometimes make people bad to sta off withi do not take an antidepressantbut have have they in the pastyou just have to keep go and stay strong eventually you will find the right medication etc just try to remember the voice be wrong your family love you and want to be thereit be very hard for ya family too as they do not really understand it properly mine right now do not eitherkeep ya head up and keep fight you will win this xxx
also look into seraquil that be a mood disorder medicine and help treat bipolar and anxiety its take at night the upside to the be they work together and cymbalta once you get to mg it can also act as a pain medicine as well
look into cymbalta it work with both depression and anxiety
you need to tell your dr your fear they need to know and they can then help you be prepared to trial different med it take I around   mth before I find the right combo
I be hospitalize for a month last year   first time that have happen I be   with bipolar   and anxiety I leave my   kid with their dad it be the good thing I ever do before I go I be so unwell I nearly end everything now I be do really well   never be afraid to get the help you need screw the stigma the people around you with brain and hea will still be there when you get out xxxx
call   get appointment   talk freely with dr so he can know how to treat you   no need to worryjust do it   you will be so glad go besideseveryone need help from time to time   everyone   some just refuse to admit it be bipolar since have learn many cope skill   you will too   god bless you
go it sound like you need to there be no shame in make sure you be well
ask for help immediately the dynamic in your household need to change so you feel and have less pressure
I know what your say I live with unreality of life and I live for my husband and kidswhen life get hard talk to someone can dilute your feeling I think a therapist or someone who will let you just release your feeling your drowning in can help but when your down you do not see any other way but if your living for people then there be a reason to stay strong I do it so my kid do not come to a place where I be even though life can be so bloody hard you need to give yourself time and maybe seek medication just to take the edge off I hope this have help and that you find your way through what can be a horrible thing to live with take care x
there be hope you can change your life but you have to stop believe their world stop because of you although I be sure you be impoant the world will not stop turn because you leave I have a nervous breakdown feel like this and the reality hit I when while I be hospitalize guess what my kid survive my husband step up and dang if no one starve or die without I we put way more pressure on ourselves box ourselves into these role we create this sense of panic and fear that stem more from our illness than from actual truth learn to say enough be enough and do not be afraid to ask for help their world be well because you be in it but it will not stop if you need your time too
it sound like you be experience some anxiety instead of focus on the positive stop think about anything calm your mind by focus on breathe in hold for    out do this sit or lie comfoably for   minute
I be like this I be fine until I sta get close to work then my stomach ache and I get nauseous and sweaty I be actually unemployed right now for that very reason it be get so bad sometimes that I just shut down and become a recluse I be medicate and I still have problem with my anxiety and depression like you I try to focus on the positive and some day that work but the thought in my head and the feeling in my stomach take over everything it be debilitate and scary but I just keep push on and try my damned to stay positive for my family good luck and lot of prayer
the second time I attend therapy have be diagnose with mdd   psychotic feature the therapist say I have so far display an emotional and dissociation disorderwhen I ask he later during the weekly session he tell I to continue take my med because they be not addictive and also commend I for my courage and consistency to attend therapy sessionsnonetheless the post on this page have undoubtedly make I realise that I have bpd look back at the year   the up and down feel like a child despite all the bihday pass by push love one away and after long for they   irrational fear attachment issue hypervigilant teary identify crisis etcooh and the biggie childhood abuse incest I be keep well in the well of up and down through god grace and strength
sadly I have both but on the bright side   I manage they well   mostly through avoidancelol   I like live in my little bubble of lonliness its safe here there be pizza too   I have bad day which can be very tax and a trial of my strength and then I have good day which remind I why I keep go thankfully I have some epic kid who make it all wohwhile and make I smile every time I be with they p I do not think I would cope without their presence in my life
shame I can not read it
every good thing take time I know how it feel like to stay at hospital I use to get ect once every   day but finally I be here still alive still breathe still fight against the voice still struggle just because you be struggle do not mean you be fail let we fight this voice together let it flow but do not give up never lose hope I have be there and I survive so will you
I be recover as well and I journal all my worry for the day and then tear they up and throw they away then I meditate for   minute it have really help I
people do not let it get to that black whole of nothingness do something about it do not be ashamed it be not your fault
you do not say what your gf be diagnose with but from what you have write sound like bipolar difficult situation if you think child be at risk or in danger then you need to do what be good for they to ensure they eat safe   you can either let she know you love she and be there to suppo she if that be what you want and that you will be there if and when thing go wrong or you can decide to make the break unfounately only you can make that decision   sound like it be time to really think what we good for the future of your child
there be not any specific medication that treat bpd so any med she will have be would have be for depression anxiety which can result in consequence of have bpd or a mood stabaliser if she also as bipolar disorder   you do not say what she be on   stop cbt especially dbt be very helpful for bpd sufferer however   her behaviour may not be a consequence of any of above cheating or have affair or abuse another person do not equal have a mental health illnesse I   would   sit dowm and speak honestly together about your relationship it maybe that it be over
I genuinely do not know how else to say this if a person be take the wrong medsno med at all their ability to think clearly and make good decision can disappear if you let she hit rock bottom how will she know she be wrong if she can not control her brain she be the mother of your child she deserve more respect she be always go to be in your life and so be her mental illness think of it this way if one of your kid develop a mental illness which be possible due to genetic how would you feel if they be clearly not well and make bad decision and god forbid their long time significant other take the kid and run I highly doubt you would suppo or respect that   right now your kid see what be go on they might not understand it but they see it no amount of good parenting will hide that do it for they because they deserve a healthy mom
many youth service organization have position that require only a hs diploma or ge you would mentor and plan activity for at risk kid one on one some college or x yrs experience in the field be usually require no degree though
alarm clock get wood
do not be afraid to ask for helpit be okay take a day at a time I hope you get the help you need
I try your way jenny franklin and I try to commit suicide twice   always with a smile on my face say that think positive and surround myself with positive thinker   I eat the right food that would help I have a clear mind and energy to live   it all fail   twice   not everyone can cope without intervention of medicine and therapy from good people   if they have not talk some sense into I about what I be do to myself I would not be here   I be deal with a loss in my family right now and this be the first time ever that I have not have a complete meltdown   I feel strong and I can be strong for my kid   they lose their dad sister to cancer and they need I to be momnot a hysterical puddle of panic attack and mood swing

I understand I have ocd depression anxiety pstd bipolar since I be   and I be   now I have be through hell I do not med anymore they do not work but I see a psy doctor and I have stae natural item and vit and stone and crystal medatation prayer and walk I just staed all this new stuff a few month ago because med do not work for I and I just turn   and I be try of the old life I be live it be not work out so well   good luck to you
I have just about all these symptom since I be about   now I be understand that maybe my poor concentration and memory loss be because of ptsd shit suck and it be the one thing I be most insecure about
wow this be I to a t but I have be tell it be just depression and anxiety disorder I know it be so much more then that
I can relate to almost everything list I have be diagnose with ptsd aboutt   year ago   everyday be a new adventure   everyday a different struggle
understand all to well I have pstd and ocd and just find out a few week ago I have bipolar   and the med I be take for ocd be poison to take   for people with bipolar   I have be sick and beg for help for a few year could not understand what be go on thought I be go crazy I scare myself so bad I call crisis hotline and they get I in with in min and talk to I and help   its not go but I feel well and work oon get well
this pretty much describe I be I in denial about why I have depressionbipolar I really should probably seek help but there to I be afraid
this whole list apa from   sum I but doctor say I just have bad depression and anxiety could that be the case
the list be complete and the struggle be real
totally understand I feel like I have lose my life I have lose my career my finance my identity my role in life the very essence of who I be bear to be   I have lose relationship as I struggle to get out of the house and commune with other my young adult child have move out so now I live alone with my little dog   two cat for company I sleep on the lounge as I be awake all night in front of the television then sleep all day which suit I well than have to endure the long hour of the day   I waver between deep dark in the hole depression   a more moderate but just as debilitate mood I frequently spend time think about suicide to the point of plan my own funeral the only thing that really keep I go be a healthy fear of god   we all have an appoint time to die   ultimately it be god decision when that be live with bpd   other mood disorder be mentally physically   spiritually exhaust   I grieve   long for the woman I use to be
I be a fellow soldier in this battle unlike a lot of people who comment day in and day out I fight   deal with dark thought lack of motivation fatigue stress anxiety   and now I have recently discover the possibility that I may also be deal with ptsd as well regardless I have no other option but to fight it out   I do not have insurance the few time that I have go to the doctor regard this crap all it be accomplish be cost I money without resolution the doctor want I in therapy for a year before we investigate medication alternative   the counselor that I have visit with want to talk about the trite   trivial issue de jour instead of give idea or suggestion as to workable solution I know all too well what hell this fight be   yet when I share what I be do people here argue about the natural solution depression be an ugly thing but with it be many valuable lesson   those of we who be not cherry know   we can tell when a person be complain because whine be the only attention they get or when a person be pour out the bs just to get the drug I wish you the good in solve this problem if that be really what you want
sound like your good at push yourself away   from life yes depression be around you but so be your head full of negativity and over thinking and pretty soon you will just be in an ugly spin not even you can control it will not be about whether you pray or who you push away your head will win and you will be paranoid at well be that what you want while you have get the strength you have get to fight for yourself and your little life   it be woh something   and quit playing game with people be honest be the good pa of you so get of bed and do stuff
I be not the one to upset today
I know someone who take it and struggle not to sleep all day be that way for mo
yes it be suppose to be for my anxiety and panic attack and my latuda for bipolar mood swing   I be be stable and happy
it would be amusing if it be not so ignorant no everything fine now I only get suicidal thought every other day now I be cure               depression be horrific because there be no pill to cure it its a lifelong struggle its as if your brain be wage war against itself and your stuck in the middle of the trench   some day be okay other be fill with selfhatre monsoon of tear and the need to quit my life and an urge to cave my own skull in with a hammer snap out of it be something you hear all the time trust mea sane healthy individual would not live this hell for   year by choice   one day it would be nice for I to explain this to someone and for they not to look at I in horror like I be some kind of leper
it be not that easy and you add to the stigma by say stuff like this many folk do not get the proper help and struggle to accept they need med please do not make it hard on fellow sick folk
I know my bipolar both on and off of med I prefer be on they I be less terrified of life I be glad that you can live off of they but I surely can not and believe I I have try
latuda leave I feel lathargic most day but I be not irritable at least I hope it work well for you
I be on mg of lamictal   it be the only thing that seem to give I at least a little relief   I have not have good luck with antipsychotic in the past so I be reluctant to try latuda    I google everything about medication before I take they   the trick be to stick to and understand the science side of thing and give very little weight to the anecdotal side of thing    it have also be my experience that the vast majority of general practitioner be not up on the late research and very few like to listen to the patient knowledge andor research   for example my doc have no clue at all that the only   mood stabilizer that be truly effective for bipolar depression be lamictal and lithium   the rest of they be more effective for maniahypomania   but at least I be lucky enough that she realize I have   year deal with bipolar and I know more about it than she do
I stop worry till symptom appear
I have to use google before I could sta take med although there be the rash worry there be not many other side effect that I would be worried about the ratio of help be potentially well I be really surprised
I try go off med as I do not like have to rely on all these tablet it be quite honestly the bad decision I have ever make in my life all be well initially and then thing would upset I then small thing upset I more and so on and so on in the end I end up in such a bad place I try to end it all I spend   day in icu now I religiously take my medication even when they be not right for I I keep regular appointment with my psych team and   year on although my med be still not right I be in a much well place than I be without they
bipolar be bipolar so yep you can be bipolar without take med I would never not take my med because I know I be bipolar and have no desire to have episode like I can have without my med we will always be bipolar there be no cure but med can help with the horrible episode help I recognize I be fall into one
I be confuse as to what you be ask
julie michelle gray I have do it without med and it make I miserable I hate life could not enjoy anything but mine be not just bipolar I have ptsd depression anxiety bipolar and adhd so yes I be medicate well than be sucidial
ooo I should know well we be all entitle to our own experience and that be mine I be not the only one who do this every single day regardless of what my bipolar tell I I be capable of the bipolar be not the boss of I I be the boss of it I do not allow myself to stay in bed no matter how much I want to I keep my irrational temper to myself because I know intellectually I be be irrational I very clearly see what the bipolar be do to I and I fight it tooth and nail every second of every day and when I get tired and want to give up I put on my big boy pant and move on so go ahead and judge I
yes I get off the med gradually now take chamomile capsule for anxiety a brain supplement for brain health a multivitamin and eat a pure diet of protein greens nuts coconut oil green tea some v balance the chemical out and exercise your body will fight to learn how to balance the chemical
I actually follow a very similar regimen as you and I find it work for I it   help I deal with my symptom without be medicate however I stay on a very strict diet and exercise regime and it help for I to have regular contact with a therapist unfounately however I have not be able to find a therapist so I have be cycle more due to life stress but I hope to be back on track soon the up and down still happen I have have to do a lot of work in therapy group and individually to learn cope skill to try to deescalate myself before I rev up to full on mania or severe depression good of luck to all
I be diagnose in I be on lamictal for a while but stop due to side effect have not take any thing since   I have be monitor myself what cause my trigger and I avoid as much as I can I have have some suicidal thought   and   sleep less night a few other stuff but I have be manage well enough I think I try hard to stay positive
I feel like lithium give I my life   I can not even say it give I my life back because for as long as I can remember internally I be out of control and cycle between deep depression to hypomanic irritable episode every couple of week   I do not want to die but I do not want to live either I be not say you can not live unmedicated but your reasoning should be balance against what type of quality of life you have medicate vs unmedicated   good of luck
I be afraid to try because I do not want to sta al over but I have gain   pound I still have mini but workable cycle
I be diagnose with bipolar when I be   now I be   year old it have be a very long hard struggle I have be see a psychiatrist this whole time along with one on one therapist group therapy which I really enjoy so   month ago I be hire as a peer suppo specialist at kingsview be I have be recieve treatment for almost   year   I   always think of my diagnosis and all the hospitalization and loose contact with all my friend and alot of my family that I be bipolar with anxiety be a curse that god be punish I   I no long feel that way because everything that I struggle through make I strong brave courageous and I can relate to other who have also struggle my life journey be not a curse it be a gift
I be on the same medication as you I hope you get your adjust to your benefit I know it be hard with stressful people in your life love yourself first then reach out to family god bless you and give you strength to take care of yourselfand family
your right I should be feel well but one of my child die in   at the age of only   year old andrew   andy he like to be call andy have   wonderful child   boy   a girl he be the first one to make I a grandmother with a boy I be get really well about my life   my mental health issue but when andy die by kill himself how do a mum cope with that my young son be very fret I they have a family     meeting   say that if I come to andys funeral that the family would remove I I be not aloud to even send flower     a card even to dill with problem I have always take thing out on myself but I get put in the linden centre chelmsford just because what I do in the past my child have a horrible up bringing which be my fault in   out of care andy   myself fall out   year before he die   I will never ever forgive myself for what happen to he the phone call to let I know at am could not stop cry for that I get put on section   family   friend need to understand about mental health I have try to call      write to my family but nothing come back to I so I have just get to live the rest of my life without my   child grandchild    great grandchild I hope all of my family     have good life be happy that be all I need they to know   I miss they all I be very proud of they all   I love redhea they so much
   depression   anxiety with symptom of ptsd bipolar and red flag for suicide
   depression   anxiety
I be dread go to the psychiatrist go to cost I big buck
I get a lot of help with anxiety and quiet the endless thinking from a book by eckha tolle call the power of now it make a lot of sense to I and help I to stay in the present and not worry about the future or let the past hold I back it take some practice but for I it work good luck to everyone
there be free app for android and iphone that have muscle relaxation exercise and breathing exercise   I use it for my anxiety and once I get more calm   its easy for I to fall asleep I use pacifica but that could be consider more for mental health than just purely sleep I also invest in a sound machine with a lot of option   and I do a nightly routine I have sleep apnea so I use a cpap as well but the breathing exercise   meditation   sound machine and routine help I immensely
I be struggle real hard with this right now
most night I can not sleep I be usually awake till at least be   or later every night I can take seroquel and it help I sleep but then I want to sleep all the time I have anxiety about go to bed but when I finally do I do not get more than   hour sleep I do not know what to do anymore
seroquel make my restless leg syndrome unbearable and I also have an anxiety disordehinkin about whether I can get some sleep make it bad       
a wise man once say you can sleep when your dead worry about it you will get there a lot quick
a wise man once say you can sleep when your dead worry about it you will get there a lot quick
battle a lot even with a zopac every night I struggle
it be be a year since the last pill I take now I face another form of mental illness why god why I know why I just want to say why if anyone offer I to change who I be to get a new different life with a new identity as a human being I pass no thank you I know it be hard to live like this especially when those people who do not understand what you be go through keep bully you but I will not exchange I my life my struggle with anything else no matter how bad it be how hard it be I be here and I be still alive and that be enough I do not think anyone else can be as strong as I be today so I will live I will do whatever it take to stay alive
no one should feel guilty for that
depression be hard really hard but when you have over active mind and brain which be powerful generator of thought and so anxiety you feel like you run so much so fast that you be die from exhaustion but still be ruin it be just
have anyone notice that most people have these feeling base on a situation but due to illness have these ugly emotion of no reason at all it be horrible when they all come together for a meeting I want it all to go away
latuda make my depression bad too and I get terrible restless leg
good question but I be afraid there be no good answer for this
everyone should be say alive you be here today still fight and battle no bell ring yet if you have be battle as many year I have since I be   I be   now still have terrible day I mean scary hearing voice see thing think someone be watch I or follow I it be scary very scary I will never get rid of this illnessdisease I take everyday like its my last hope everything work out livelovelaugh
I have alarm set in my phone so I never forget my med if that fil I have a routine breakfast the get dress and take my med which be beside my bed with a bottle of water then at night I get change for bed and take my tablet I take they the same time every day so the routine be pretty much set in stone but the phone alarm be the key to get a routine staed and it be impoant to take med at the same time everyday so you maintain consistent concentration
horrible I be space out drive erratic do nothing
try it become very irritable and angry bad than I already be my psychiatrist say that zoloft be not recommend for people who be bipolar
I have zoloft and hear voice and scream on my ear especially when I be try to sleep I also use to see shadow and thing fly horrible
I be on zoloft all of the dosage and it just make I bad the side effect of it be horrible I end up in the hospital because of the bad thought and before I could sta a new medication I have to let zoloft out of my system so the withdrawal be horrible as well I be so sick I could not move because of the withdrawal I do not recommend zoloft to noone I do not like it
I be on   mg now I stae zoloft to help my anxiety and panic attack and I be try to get pregnant so zoloft be all I could safely take I be   week pregnant still on it it help I a ton I have have maybe   panic attack since stae it my anxiety be calm even my depression be less I be not get as many nightmare and flashback now I be more likely to go out of the house and do stuff now I be hope be on it now will help stave off post paum depression but my doctor be prepare just in case it still happen
I just stae it a week ago I be take it for bad anxiety I really hope it wirk
it stop work for I the initial side effect be horrible
yeah it be scary as hell I will never ever let they prescribe that and that happen like   year ago
hi I be on   mg of zoloft it take a good   yrs to work properly   I still have bad day I be also on neulactil for anxiety   high   adrenalin I use to be on effexor slow release tablet but I have to stop they due to have hea attack   effexor make you be hea beat fast which my hea could not handle anymore cos I get tacky cardia   angina I do not think there be a tablet out there that will fix depression   completly   hey I could be wronge
do not do much of anything for I but be the absolute bad to come off of I lose   pound because I be so sick I could not eat anything veigo be absolutely horrid just an awful experience all around
it send I into a dark mania and I be suicidal terrifying time
they wonder why every high profile massacre have a person with a mental disease no one listen to we they have no idea what a panic attack be on top of withdrawal feel like they could not imagine learn recently if I miss   appt with my doc he will not see I any more sad
I totally understand I remember before I have med use to be full of pain scared of the chest call panitc attack pain cause anger people would say pray but I never feel much relief it be a mental problem
I struggle with rapid cycling bipolar disorder post tramatic stress disorder body dysmorphic disorder and anxiety and I have not be on any medicine for an entire year it have be so hard for I to make it through the month it be physically and mentally drain I end up in the hospital two time in   month for suicidal attemp and self harm I know its hard right now but we will get through it if I can make it through than you can too it might seem dark at time but there be a light at the end of the tunnel there be a quote that always keep I go suicide do not end the pain it just passess it on to someone else message I if you need anything
I be sure this be helpful and interesting but my anxiety can not take it oh the irony
I be watch it right now half way true I do notice that it trigger my depression I have bordeline and alot of trust issue with man which play a big pa in the show due to be sexualize   rape etc   so I watch it in my own pass and take day in between episode so it be not overwhelming
I will not watch it out of fear it will trigger I not woh the risk
dosage may be to high lithium when husband be on it he could not drink soda and they would do blood work every two week to ensure his level be not too high you can actually get lithium poison if not monitor and can make you feel bad   he only be able to drink gatoradewater and ginger ale zoloft be hit or miss but I would ask they to reduce the dosage to   and add hydroxizine taate for sleep and anxiety attack wellbutrin   stay far far away because that shit do not work and make you feel more suicidal at good lithium I do not recommend because my husband be on it and kill himself I just say the amount he be on be high in correlation between other medication he take it for epilepsy and bipolar disorder but I would ask for the   mg of zoloft clonzapam work wonder but most doctor will not prescribe it due to be a narcotic
I go out and do not spend the whole of the next day worry about what I say
great idea I vote for medal instead to be place around the neck of the recipient by the stigma doubter that hassle they
I get   sticker today I survive a panic attack and I do not hide in the bathroom because I do not hide in the bathroom I hide in the house   
I be highly allergic make my anxiety worse and slur speech send I back to the hospital more than once dr say to stop take it immediately
I be on   mgs for about three week and we quit it I have an almost six week withdrawal from it it be still go on I be very space out I keep have awful panic attack and I can not concentrate on anything I also keep get extremely confused it be awful I hate it
I be incredibly paranoid on it have to be take off quickly
I have be in your situation beforeit be horrible this be legit try goodrxcom or they have an appyou can get huge discount on your med I have to use it a few time especially for my effexor I could go without the other but damn I feel like I be die without the effexor end up I only have to pay   out of pocket for my script it be woh a shot you can enter your med and then it give you price at your local pharmaciesyou just go in show they your phone with your cardmember number that goodrx give you and you get the med for that price

I have personally never have insomnia from it I now take seroquel at night to help with a long term problem with stay asleep the good ever me for anxiety for I have be busparone it work so well it change my life I take lamectal lamotrigine to stabilizer so my behavior do not get extreme venlafaxine as an antidepressant and busparone for anxiety take I about six week to get they all to level out I have fatigue headache and swinge mood but they have pretty much be resolve you must stick with it for   week
I have be on it forever definetly help with deppression the only bad thing be now I can not get off to try anything new because the withdrawl be horrible
vemladaxine be antidepressant and not aware it have paicularly beneficial sedative side effect   venlafaxine be one of the drug I take for many year for depression   anxiety and like any of these drug you can feel bad initially because it be help your brain function   warning though do not miss a dosage withdrawal symptom be horrendous and I mean horrendous
be at my psychiatrist todayhe say after   year bipolar diagnosis that I have   unstable personality disorder can you tell I what this mean in relation to pip I have not get   the letter yet and be really confused as it seemingly encompass disacociative disorder with non epileptic episodesblackout due to which I have have to surrender my drive licence help
never hear that beforeintereste I take medication for depression and anxiety I try mindfulnessbut it do not work well for I
it be a good place to sta but my depression and anxiety can be root in the present as well sometimes more so
wish this work for those of we that have chemical imbalance induce depression and anxiety
right I have panic attack for   year for no reason and   year ago diagnose with gad and bipolar   mine come out of nowhere dr say it be a chemical imbalance for I not bring on by environmental factor just get to wait it out until my body regulate I take medication for anxiety but nothing for depression have not have an episode in   year hope I never do again I do not like take med and so far every cocktail they have try on I I have have horrible reaction to
I have bipolar I and anxiety which be treat with medication I also use therapy because medication can only do so much for I it be a balance act and it be hard work it would be nice to be able to take a pill and be do with it lol
thank you for post on my post I be just so nervous the last time I be put on anything be zoloft   it pretty much make I almost kill myself it give I horrible thought
each person respond differently to med so keep that in mind   I have be on it for near   year when first take it I feel miserable from the side effect but it do not last long
sorryposte before I finish write I know they be very expensive to prescribethat be why   they be not give out until you have try other medication they honestly be really good I have not have any problem with they except when I stae take they even then it be just get use to they I have be on they for several year nowbut from how I be feel nowi know they work my gp do tell I that if   when I reduce the dosageit should be in the summer   not when it be bad weather he say the winter can make people with depressionanxiety feel low anyway I really hope these work for you gabrielle xx
they do work for a little while anxiety subside and generally lift mood downside which doc fail to mention to I extremely addictive and once on they extremely difficult to ever come off I go cold turkey and it be horrendous they have one of the low half life of all the anti depressantstry go on some forum what I do and you will generally get the same as what I be say I have never feel well since be off they not say   they do not work but it could be a long term commitment once they in your system
not sure what med you be on but you do need an anti psychotic to stop the paranoia and high anxiety it be the only base type of drug that work
I be the same way     I be not confused though it be what my bipolar anxiety issue do to I I do ask myself do I take my med when do I last sleep hope you be on med and they be work for you if not go see a doctor or psychiatrist and get on a regiment that be trail and error but you can do it be kind to yourself and mindful of your pattern mentally awareness of your   mental state truly help I tell myself stop and listen breathe and smile     keep on keep on we be always here
ayewhat if you have bothconstant struggle for I  
my personal opinion be that this cha give a poor description of both it use professional term that a lot of people do not know the meaning or understand I also find it interesting that under bipolar it say episode of mania term a lot of people do not know or understand associate with euphoria again   what be that and depression and under bpd it say mood inaccurate information   bpd be not a mood disorder it be a personality disorder change include irritability sadness feeling of emptiness and anxiety those be all symptom of depression and see in mania and where be they measure if it be a personality problem situational mood or something else bpd be most problem due to relationship and how one view the world which this cha say nothing this cha have too many whole in leave one still confused I be diagnose with bipolar disorder and generalize anxiety more than   year ago it be very clear I be manic and depressed and anxious most of the time but continue to have other problem that be untreated and not symptom of bipolar or anxiety last summer when I go to the hospital be finally diagnose with bpd it do not take away the other diagnosis I have be a third disorder it be sad that it take so long and of all people be not even a dr to find the problem nurse mention it before I ever see the dr base on our interaction and after spend hour with the dr talk about what be go on and what have happen for year dr confirm and not to mention bipolar be treatable with a combination of medication and counseling technique bpd be only treatable with therapy and from what I have be tell only thing that work be dialectic behavior therapy
jo I be wonder the same thing I have always struggle with the right med for bipolar over   year and when I go to the hospital last year they tell I I have bpd I be still not be treat for it because med do not treat it and I can not get dbt
the way my mental health nurse explain it to I have bpd be like bp but its have a month woh of up down and switch feeling be   day which be why it be so dangerous but treatment be very similar I be misdiagnose with bp for year and I keep say they be wrong now I have a real diagnosis and they can see why I struggle in a day as I do not no how I feel from   min to the next people do not no enough about bpd and I have be treat aporlingly by medical professional sick of judgment now I have a suppoive mental health team and I finally think I have a chance to get well not just for I but my child
yeah it say bipolar be not relate to life event but when life event get crazy which eventually they always do all hell break loose and as someone who have bipolar you definitely can have the irritability and sadness and anxiety because you be a fucking person not just a set of clinical symptom
it really all make perfect since if you think about it now that be reason to be paranoid
I often think maybe I might have borderline personality disorder instead of have bipolar disorder I rarely have hypomania and euphoric episode I get irritated easily and often feel very anxious doctor be constantly misdiagnose patient
with bpd sometimes medication be not helpful you can have it to help with the anxiety   depression with it but the actual illness be about learn cope strategy and dbt therapy   sandi
o I wish I have the book now it sound so good it be a shame that I do not have anyone in my hometown I can talk to when I be feel low but it be nice talk to you bambi stell you sound like a lovely person   
do not listen to people that know nothing about the illness I can understand how you feel like you be not yourself it be like your can not control your thought or emotion my daughter suffer bpd so I see she struggle every day you need to find a good psychologist that specialise in mood disorder and do dbt therapy medication can help but not alwayssandi
I be sorry for your loss I lose my mum to cancer   yrs ago do it get easy yes and no I have a love hate relationship with my mum and one of my great regret be have an argument with she in hospital and it be the last time she be able to speak there be always time when vulnerable like when I be sick in trouble need advice etc where it seem bad but then on my good day I will find myself think about good time it will always have an affect on you but it be how you choose to remember that be impoant think about grief counselling it help
thank you so much I have a diagnosis of depression and anxiety I basically sit and wait for my next anxiety panic attack
I be highly allergic make my anxiety much bad slur speech and send I back to the hospital more than once
I would check your diagnosis as suggest by other to confirm if you be bp or   from what you say sound like bp when depressive episode more frequent and hypomania episode rather than mania     or have bpd you could have cooccurre diagnosis such as anxiety depression compulisive behaviour etc which med can help or you
a therapeutic dosage for some people be mg for other people it can be as high as mg a day try not to be freak out by all the side effect mention yet if you notice anything unusual tell your dr immediately   I be wonder if some of you be mistake this drug for an antidepressant lamictal be use as a mood stabilizer in psychology if a bipolar person take an antidepressant without take a mood stabilizer it will because a manichypomanic episode the lamictal help the mood swing think of your mood like a pendulum the lamictal keep you from swinge too far either way keep the scary low from be so severe this type of drug be necessaryeven when you feel well do not stop take your medication unless direct by your dr   I have try almost every mood stabilizer they make as well as antiseizure medication for mood stabilization in total I have be on it about   year they have try other but always go back to lamictal hope this help good luck to all of you
one of the only med so far that have work for I it definitely help and I be impatiently wait to get to my target dose so I can feel the full effect of be level and happy

if I understand correctly you be feel suicidal because you be alone and you be struggle your disorder it be also impoant to remember that our disorder do not define we they do not define we because it be how we deal with they and how we move forward that do a good suppo network be very impoant maybe go to see a psychologist or register counsellor could help but if those just do not do it for you there be many form of therapy include a and anything creative look into it it be something that could be woh look into

my dvds have to be organize if it be a series they have to be in order and straighten and all face the same way if one get disturb it bug I and I have to fix it I check the oven numerous time to make sure it be off fold towel a ceain way   make sure their straight when I hang a towel on a towel bar in the bathroom it gas to be straight and the tag can not be show when I get ready to go out I have to get ready in order like brush my hair first put my contact in brush tooth etc I can not touch thing with my bare hand that other people have touch   also I do not like shake hand I either have to use glove or sanitizer I drive the same route to get to and from a familiar place I can not sit where someone have just sit it feel too weird I have to switch seat
I also have obsessive thought a lot
god bless you angela raineyi can identify with every word you wroteso I know exactly how you feel   I wear myself out in my own mind   life get so confusing to I sometimes that I can not manage to have one clear thoughtright now my brain be so scramble its make I upset   nauseousoh lord
I definitely find it to alot bad when I staam unstable I have to clean the house top to bottom and throw out a heap of thing it almost feel like a cleansing and it feel like it be the only thing leave that I have control of I be very paicular about where thing be put in my pantry how my food be cut and cook how the toilet be clean etc however in say that when thing be really bad it be only a few of those thing that I can not let go of everything else go to shit because I can barely make it off the couch however my mind be still race and it be difficult to get any real sleep so hard to explain because I can not understand it myself I have bipolar   anxiety and ocd lucky I lol
it take I a few year to be completely rid of the brain shakesick
I do not know   I take cymbalta as well and I can not get past the dizzys   I make my doctor put I back on it   unfounately I be at the high dose for therapeutic use   little scared of what they will have to use next   I hate withdrawl
never be ashamed to talk and be in control of it
I think most people say I be bipolar not because they be define themselves but because it be easy than state I be diagnose with bipolar disorder every time they be seek advice from people who can relate or when they reply to a comment and want the person post to know what their diagnosis be and whether or not they can relate to their situation and or medicationtreatment choice I be not sure what exactly the purpose behind your post be but I hope it be not mean to judge or put down anyone who may not express themselves in the same manner as yourself I would like to think that page such as this be mean for people suffer from mental illness to have a place to be free of negative judgment a place where we can relate to one another suppo one another seek advice from one another and most impoantly speak freely without fear of judgment especially because outside of these page we with mental disability continue to be look upon negatively we need one anotheror at least I need you all let we love and suppo one another and yes I be bipolarredhea
exactly and I be glad people be come down on the other side of the coin on this I do not need a guilt trip for be colloquial if I be tell my friend I be have a manic episode I say I be manic I will probably type the full proper language out of fear of chide from the ableism god but who need that bs
I like what you say you have a good point I say I be bipolar when I have cancer I never say I be cancer   but to I say I be bipolar be no more shameful than say I be diabetic it be not a label   it be an explanation
I have depression anxiety and ptsd I have a sister who be schizophrenic when it come to word phrase it would be correct to either say she be schizophrenic or she have schizophrenia both phrase be correct I know depression be not the same as be bi polar that be not my point
only a doctor know what they should be you and you really I use to be on depakote and it do the exact same thing to I very irritable but it also make I very angry when I would take it so I stop on my own take it and it seem like yes I still have to deal with depression and anxiety and be bipolar at time but I would rather do with the sad and lonely in my hea and in my mind my soul and everything I do be judge unaccepted I would rather just die honestly I be so tired of this life because everytime I try to do right it seem that I never care or it be never good enough for anyone not for my family my brother my sister my girlfriend her friend anybody I do not care any more myself or maybe I do care too much and I just do not know how to express it so I be give up
you do not say what your diagnosis be but you be take med for a range of mental health illness depokate be primarily for bipolar latuda be primarily to treat schizophrenia cumbalta be and anti depressant ritalin be a stimulating mainly for adhd impulsive behaviour and xanax anxiety panic disorder you be not only over mediate but combination of some of these med be potential dangerous and will coutaract each other I   would seriously find out what your diagnosis do you have schizophrenia or experience psychotic symption such as hear voice hallunications delusion paranio or bipolar if not I would determine why you on these med   you need to research the med you take
I would say over medicated be an understatement but that be purely my personal opinion I can tell you from my experience though that I too be on a huge combination of med staedfeele overmedicated and stop take they huge mistake I now only take   mg of depakote at bedtime because it do have side effect that I do not notice take it at bed time klonopin for anxiety at night as well as my zoloft at night
if you only get to see the doc for   minute I would say   that be not acceptable it take some time to listen to your symptom and see if you be do well I be not a doc either but check with a pharmacist friend he feel it be definitely possible you be be overmedicate and your doc be just throw more med at you instead of well med that work ask that doc exactly what each of they be for ritalin it rarely work to stop race thought and anxiety find out what each be for tell doc that the combo be not work for you and ask about alternative do your own research too look up each of the med and empower yourself with knowledge
I use to worry about what they give you to take but they be highly train people who do know what they be do so good to stick to they to ask question as dangerous to listen to all different people as these be strong med you can not just stop they they need lower by the phycharist
not sure about the med but you only see they   min   I see mine hrmonth bpd be complicated and I would really doubt in   min they could get an accurate feel for your current situation
from this medication list I be go to assume that you be be treat for bipolar disorder if that be true then you should not be on the cymbalta as this can make your bipolar bad the xanax if take everyday latuda and depakote can be contribute to your fatigue the ritalin can be contribute to the anxiety which I be assume be what the xanax be for I be not a psychiatrist and be not yet a health professional currently still in pharmacy school so I can only give you a personal opinion and not a medical opinion but in my personal opinion yes you be be overmedicate but I ceainly have see patient on more med and bipolar and mental health in general be a complex disease state to treat as for your depakote you should get use to the new medication anywhere from   to   month if the irritability and fatigue do not go away by then or if they be affect your daily life you should go talk to your psychiatrist about these effect and hopefully heshe will change up your therapy edit please please please do not stop any of your medication without discuss they with your prescriber first
sound like the depakote be nullify the effect of the ritalin you will be irritable if you be very tired I do not all the other drug your on except depakote talk to your doctor soon
that be a lot to mix and match without know what you be problem be its hard to say if they be overkill I know they all do different thing but I would speak to they see if there be well combination drug or if any be really need as sometimes you can take   that end up help for a few thing and you then do not need the other so much its always woh ask if you be worried they be give you to many a specially if you get a lot of side effect if you be get irritable and tired do bring that up as its not woh it I have that with   of mine now I be on something different its so much well but do not be afraid to voice you be opinion and if you feel you need more suppo see about a mental health nurse as they see you reg basis I see mine every few week and they be so helpful
some people will not acknowledge that depression anxiety and panic attack be an illness imagine they will think different when it happen to they let I reassure you it be an illness it take second just too ask how someone be try it maybe one day you may be in that position wonder if any of your friend and famiy care about you
I have be bipolar fori can not remember most of my   year of life it be truly pa of I it be an illness for sure I have have it so long and will die with it I be not go to hide from it I be not ashamed of it a spade be a spade I be bipolar regardless of how anybody else want to put it
what a love of god to show and share shame on your grudge may forgiveness and mercy be bless to you
what be a holiday they do not get it be not easter for we yesterday it be sunday which be just like saturday and friday and so on these annual event holiday for they be just another day for we to be even more anxious about our day and give heed to we hide in seclusion from our family they will never understand it    good thing to do be stop expect they too and stop subject yourself to the exposure if it
if he be not currently seek help this sound to I like he be not open to it so you need to get as far away from he as possible bipolar be a life long illness   if he be not seek help thing will not get well will not get well your just try to rationalise a way to keep the relationship go   you just can not in this situation even medicate   counsel he will continue to have episode they may be less violent it I doubt it very much in this situation because he know he have control over you through fear
sorry to distract from original post of abuse when refer to myself I say I be bipolar it be a personal choice to decide it be weave through the very core of I I be not ashamed of it nor quiet about it I be medicate and have work hard to remove coexist personality disorder now cure of that yes perdi be curable with hard work I   be high function most of the time when I be not I take time off from life sotospeak to recover most people except employer know of my struggle at least depression
you need to prioritize your physical safety give what suppo you can from a safe distance or with a group of friend mental illness be a reason for his behavior but not an excuse do not let yourself be injure or threaten
my good friend be a lot like I    he and I both have ptsd bi polar along with a few other thing   we can fight push the boundary and still end laugh maybe not the same day but mostly he be get a very violent temper and so do I   although I would not put my hand on anyone he would   we have have some really beyond boundary fight and he would not ever lay a hand on I   I be safe with he first guy in my life I be safe with leave just leave be with someone control and violent regardless of bipolar be not ok   do not let he hu you it will not get well and its your life and your peace of mind you need to protect   I learn this way too late and wish I have leave my husband in the first year of marriage instead I stay live in fear and much very horrific abuse for   year   he finally be sentence to   yrs in federal prison   he be be there    he get out in   I be back to be afraid and so much more   just go get out for you
I myself be bipolar and so be my ex we both have two opposite reaction when we be have off day he would not want to be alone where I hate be bother we end up not work out because when I want to be alone he would nag I and get mad because I would go to another room it eventually get to the point he would corner I and I would sta panic if that would happen he would sta spit in my face and slap I abuse be not a relationship if someone love you he would not put his hand on you I stay with my ex way long than I need to I stay until it be life or death if I be you I would get out of the relationship you can love someone but your life be way more impoant than to be abuse by they
he obviously need help and I hope he be willing to get it but at this point I do not think it be your responsibility and you definitely should not tolerate such terrifying abuse
hold on tight please you be not alone if you want to talk do not hesitate mp
I be in a similar boat I be alone I have bpd depression and bad anxiety in everything go every friendship fail and relationship be mess up unfounately you just get to push your way through hold that head up try to make a life you want that be what I be do even though be a massive struggle chin up I know life be tough you can do it believe I I can relate to your pain
sure this website be for anyone if you have question or if you struggle with issue or know someone who be we all have be there and we be all here for each other
I be so sad to see all of these comment about love one leave or think it over before you commit    I understand that it be hard for the paner to watch their love one go through this I have bipolar depression    the leaving or doubt about life with someone who suffer this it be go to make the person fall deeply into the darkness   my boyfriend understand I yes it be hard but he suppo I and help I up out of the dark   I usually have more low than high but he be with in both
I be pretty much alone   I do not have any close friend anymore and my family do not really want anything to do with I   I be alone   of the time and I be struggle get use to it   it be hard not to have anyone to turn to or talk with
I have bipolar   and my husband do not it be hard for he I try but it be hard for I to control it sometimes I feel guilty for marry he sometimes but he tell I he can not imagine life without I I would think it over specially if you be not fully commit yet it be hard on my love one then I at time that be why I always tell he that if it get to be too much let I go self help come first no matter what side your on read about it research go to a meeting call nami for info then only you can make that decision it be not easy but it be woh the love redhea  
it be nice from you to seek advice I believe there be   different   level or severity of bipolar but at the end we all deal with the same monster also it can be mix with anxiety depression add adhd some can function and some can not it be like not know how you be go to feel tomorrow or   hour from now
when they be upset remember it be not you it be something they have to work through in their head just listen and comfo they
confusing as the change between up and down can be as if a switch have be throw that be what it feel like to I
so sorry do not be afraid to see a doctor if you have not already pray for you it can be tough tomorrow hope for a well day hug

thank for your bravery I too feel like you I be come up on the end of my life expectancy and be scared as well I remember however that it be just a good guess live to the full every day work for I I hope you find peace my friend

I have have anxiety my entire adult life since my early s   I be pretty much antimed myself and never take medication unless I really really need to   when my anxiety level be high I need to take my antianxiety medication   meditation and yoga and exercise be great   I be all for it   but when I be in the throe of a panic attack they would not help I at all   in fact I be fairly sure that would just make I more anxious   what I need to do be take a pill and go somewhere where I can calm myself down   period   end of sentence
anxiety medication   xanax
I forgot to take mine today I really wish I have not I have be out all afternoon and even with my bf and my service dog my anxiety be much high than I have get used to handle
I be try to keep a promise make after my last fail attempt each day be a struggle day fill with pain sorrow and yes despair pray for all who must fight this fight pray for I
they be do study now and say take a probiotic daily be good for depression anxiety and order mood disorder   a healthy gut keep the immune system happy and also help with the seratonin level   kid with autism as well   it be woh try I think
weed only with bipolar   that be insane advice you try to make her manic if its just anxiety I agree   if its depression weed only mask the problem it do not treat it after the high your back at square one
I do but just like any other antidepressant I do not respond well to it and make I more depressed I have never have a good response to antidepressant and a psychiatrist from the hospital say she would never give they to I because my symptom would not be a good fit for they anxiety and mania medication work wonder for I and balance out my depression antipsychotic have the same reaction as antidepressant they all sedate I   so that I can not function
definitely communicate do not wait until way down the road to bring something up that bother you during your engagement be a good time to practice and explore how to communicate during a stressful event utilize that it will help your marriage go smoother because it will help make communicate a habit
as some have suggest it be good to communicate with he and he may be upset when he read this as your post may come up in his feed it be sad when you feel unloved but many people face depression without a paner so you should discuss your feeling with he if you be engage you must have trust and feel able to discuss your feeling as for money it be immaterial and should not equate to how much someone love you it be sometimes more rewarding just stop in and listen to music and smile as for every moment of sadness there will be a new day on the horizon if you can talk to one another you can celebrate everyday and be content know that you be not alone concentrate on the good thing you share x
I would sta with your dr maybe you need a increase in doseor different medicine with your new life change come stress stopbreatheuse what you have learn keep your head up
you be under a lot of stress and that will really compound your depression and mood the most normal people be greatly affect by these type of situation it would be so good if you could see a psychiatrist because they be much more knowledgeable about these medication you may be able to see a psychiatric nurse practitioner and it would be less expensive just keep breathe sweet pea you will make it
I would imagine the fact you be look for teach   post be cause some stress and anxiety you   most people would feel under pressure in this situation so its not abnormal to feel like that you should write down exactly how you be feel to try and identify the trigger which may enable you to move forwards and try and address it   your gp could increase your dosage as   mg be low dose of prozac or there be many it her anti depressant which be also good get anxiety such as seraline zoloft
I can not and will not comment on your medication since I be not a doctor relocate search for work and just be a teacher be stressful enough use the cbt as it well apply to you discuss medication with professional and your feeling and plan with all friend available attempt to do what you feel be good for you trust your judgment good luck
that be a lot of pressure to be under look for a new job be extremely stressful what you be go through be normally very challenging to someone not on med you should talk to your dr about adjust your med and get to a therapist so you can talk through what be go on in your life
I agree that exercise meditation yoga and positive thinking be good for mental health however there be more to mental health than exercise and positive thinking depression be real and can kill if not properly treat everyone respond differently gp generally be not knowledgeable about mental illness I be get refill from mine and my med actually should have be change but she do not have the expeise to treat I I have a spiral down hill with many trip to the hospital because I be so suicidal and mania so high mix with anxiety it actually get much bad go see a psychiatrist counseling be helpful sometimes I get frustrated because I feel like the technique be blame I for be sick I think it be learn to use they appropriately which be not always teach correctly
I would talk to the gp and consider more therapy sometimes we just need a refresher on the technique for help ourselves I have no doubt that the job stressor be what be cause this relapse so just go talk through it with someone
I think this be suppose to be a place to come for suppo tell a person who be already struggle in a deep amount of pain that no one care be even more huful and trigger sound like some people be stick in their own dysfunction project it onto other and do not know the skill of when to be quiet
I have be with my husband for   year   let I tell you we have be thru a lot of struggle deal with finance we have both come to realize that monetary thing be not as impoant as just be together the most impoant thing come from the hea not the wallet
tell he how you feel but honestly if you expect to be give something or have something special do for you every   month you will be truly disappointed think about the good thing do he treat you right every other day do he show his love every other day my husband and I have be together for   year it be only in the past   yrs that he be actually mad an effo to celebrate our anniversary he tell I he love I ever day and kiss I every day so I be nit worried about what he do not do on the anniversary   can take a while to realise the small thing matter more but once you do realise it be such a relief

I think I keep say the wrong thing andor over burden people that do not know I very welli be open and genuine   but I think that may be misread I feel pretty awful and guilty if I have make they feel bad also for some I once knewknew I as friend and colleague just seem to think ignore I wasis the good option which I think be a bit harsh and cold heae especially give the fact they know my mental health be in flux and they be mhpspretty sure some other former colleague would not have act in the same way if they knewi do not expect to be treat in such a wayi be aware that when I be high I be spew out stuff all over the placebut surely if they understand anything about bipolar disorder they would not find that a good enough reason to treat I like the shit they must scrape of their shoe   major disappointment I feel guiltyashamed embarrassed for try to communicate at all I wish I have just remain silent which be my usual coping mechanism when I go to ground but be high totally override your self control and inhibition which have obviously upsetannoyedpisse off and disgust some folksfeeling so despondent and isolated at this point       
do insurance cover this I have think about ect and struggle with bipolar disorder
I have etc for a few month I can not recommend it I have have severe memory loss I have no memory of time   year before ect I struggle with memory and cognition today and although I can not prove it I feel comfoable say my sense have become more sensitive and I be now easily overwhelmed I feel it be the bad thing I have ever do but that be for I many people do not respond the same way I just always feel like people should have inform consent I be never tell anything like this could happen but it do I know several other who have have similar experience good luck with whatever you try
hey I mean I mention it once to my parent because I genuinely feel I should never get well but they adamantly refuse and tell I I would get well I still struggle a lot in term of mood swing borderline personality disorder anxiety and depression but if you make your mental health your top priority in your life you will see a drastic improvement engage in group and individual therapy be compliant with medication and do not be afraid to look for other therapy and psychiatrist sometimes it take a while to find a good fit and that be okay
do not stress yourself over it    think about the other thing experience good thing      you have fall too deep in you depression   get out     for someone shall never fall as deep andit be the gravity right
I go thru this with latuda holy heck it be awful puke headache veigo itching paranoia cry spell god help we all
it be not one of the official withdrawal symptom but that do not mean it be not relate if you be unsure it be usually good to consult with your doctor httpwwwdrugsdbcomrxseroquelseroquelwithdrawal
I be not familiar with that ceain type of medication however your body eg the neck pain and ache be go to need time to adjust to the transition I would not worry too much unless your pain persist for more than at least a couple of month   the only analogy I can think of be a woman go through   month of pregnancy and her body be not go to bounce back the day of bih   nonetheless hope everything work out
do you struggle with separation anxiety in relation to your ptsd I lot of that be come through to I in your post my sense be the relationship be highly volatile and charge and emotional and ultimately not good for your condition but it would take some intensive counseling for you to work through your feeling and get to a stable footing good luck
I be sorry to hear of your trouble   there be so many of we out there but be afraid to speak   thank you for your story I be sorry you have to go through this
I be sorry but the person say be in a relationship with a bipolar person be the last thing you need be terrible advice as someone who be bipolar   and ultra rapid cycling I can tell you I be a whole new brand of crazy my husband that have spend   year with I and go through this battle with I would say the same my husband be not bipolar but have sever depression and anxiety himself we suppo each other on my good day he lean on I on my bad day I lean on he we learn about each other issue and how to help each other we do couple therapy to heal some of the wound I cause before I be diagnose and properly medicate never give up on someone just because they have a mental illness live with bipolar disorder or any other anxiety depression disorder we hard especially with bipolar because of the stigma you feel ashamed and unaccepted and scared for people to know because you never know how they will react   from my own personal experience I be not completely open with my husband or anyone close to I until I be finally properly medicate and think clearly I have relationship that get strong and I have relationship with friend that end because they never want to learn what it really be like not just the movie and if you be a bipolar person out there who feel like you can not be in a relationship because of your mental illness you be wrong it be possible I be not go lie and say it be easy shit at one point I be throw thing across the room at my husband head for no reason but he understand I need more help then I have I get the right help now I be happy healthy stable and work closely with my psychiatrist to plan stae a family live life to full with mental illness be possible
what anti anxiety do you take I have also be have a lot of trouble wake up to alarm lately out of nowhere
I be really back and foh either I can not sleep at all or I sleep through like   alarm I be currently not take anything for sleep but have be on effexor and welbutrin for year
no my job be a huge source of stress for I stae a new one soon and my husband do not believe my diagnosis I do not really have friend either
atm whatever I take up as a hobby have to be kid friendly because my lil one will get into it all and that would stress I   she be be put into daycare for a couple day a week for I to be able to have mummy time
your paner have to be understand it be hard be in a relationship in the first place add bipolar to that be even hard my marriage have be struggle a lot because of my bipolar disorder my husband try really hard to understand and be patient but he be only human so we argue and fight but at the end of the day we still say I love you and kiss goodnight we know we want to be together so we be willing to fight for it
if I can only forgive myself I do not do nothing right I try and try and just get so sick to my stomach because I be ashamed I do not want to run just do not know what be the good thing for I to doi love my kid just they be live there livesso I do not seem to be like no matter how much I tryi have so many problem just people do not get iti just want to be happy and love so my mind go back and foh what be the good thing to do for I I share because if it can help other maybe I walk and use to work I have so much paini have to keep it together I have my dog and place and my son also just do not see he anymore really and two other in another statethen my sister also so when do it endi try all med also nothing
I can not   I avoid as much as possible   lately it be be a combo of latuda valium neurontin seroquel evil drug which I be stop today after I talk to my psychiatrist at my appointment and alcohol   I do little to nothing   I be exercise but get too depressed to do that   I be go to address all this today with my psychiatrist except the alcohol pa   he will take away my valium if he know I be drink   the seroquel turn I into a zombie   it be suppose to be for sleep   I sleep for   hour then wake up and eat like a pig and just lie there until I fall back asleep   be sleep from be to noon every day   that need to change too
by distract yourself with tv book and video game until you have train yourself to act without allow your head to intervene then all you have to worry about if night because that be when everything that you have block up come flood in
when I be young I remember my little sister have toileting issue until she be   year old doctor find a minor issue with her bladder it be not serious but eventually it happen for she maybe you could take your little one to see a doctor about her issue with toileting this could really help yours   hers situation   relieve some of the stress on yourself I would also recommend seek government assistancesuppo to help with your financial situation until your back on your foot   I would defer university for a semester it be not easy to go through what your go through although there be step you can take to ease or even rectify your great stress lastly if your psych be not meet your need try explain this to himher otherwise search for one you feel would be more suitable for you
hug hugsyour not a failure your dealing with something be right now and I have experience this many timesall my doctor do be change or increase my med as welli to have no friend I also have massive anxiety which cause I to avoid peoplepm I if you would like I will listen
first you have get to tell this to family your child need to be safe so you can get a break and so yourself out parent sibling father parent who can take the pressure off you for a week or so if you be fail class you need to look at your option talk to your teacher and tell they you have a medical situation cause this temporary slump in grade but what be your option you may need time off due to the break up because you will not be able to concentrate or sleep well and free counseling be something you probably need to heal try and stay on the med and let they settle new med take about six week to fully work good luck do not forget to find a bipolar suppo group in your area
my wife leave I because of my bipolar disorder recently as well   no child involve thankfully    I do not know what I be go to do either   I work   day a week washing dish at my familys restaurant   I be a college educate professional and just can not work in the corporate environment anymore    I have some some saving that I be live on but it will not last forever   I be go through a bankruptcy and divorce at the same time too   I be just stuck   I sleep and watch tv mostly try to exercise but have be fail miserably at that lately    I drink too which be not good   just know that other people be struggle too   I keep tell myself that thing be go to work out but nothing change
stop worry about what you do not have an be thankful for what you do have an when you have that child it become about he not you get in a good church go to class online they have grant
first   foremost do not take the stress of work home with you use the time you be not work do something you enjoy and relax a bit if there be any way to go to local group that might be helpful too or even religious service if you be a religious person also although I know it can be hard to get up early if you have a lot of fatigue but it really help to have extra time to get your day staed and make your morning routine something that pump you up and motivate you for the day these be thing that help I at least and I hope it can help you too
well first you should congralate yourself that you can hold dowm a job and a highly pay one apa from allow time for appointment give you chance to reduce your hour or change duty even for temporary period refer you to occupational health for suppo ensure you dobt experience   discrimination bully etc at work not sure what else you think they should do I do not know where you be from or what sector you work in sometimes you need to step back and if that mean change job or take less stressful low pay job for your health then you zhpujd consider it I have have to except that although I have a reasonable job with a reasonable salary I be never go to be able to do a more senior job due to my mh and I have really struggle to accept that and not feel and if I be a failure but I know for I that be how it be
my experience too work be not understand and on top of it I have coworker threaten I as well as supervisor end up walk out and get baker act now try for disability difficult surviving let alone deal with the disorder prayer for all
be a stress leave an option maybe you just need a little break to recharge your battery
all I can offer be my thirst know what bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder be about I have the depression and hypo mania of bipolar disorder ii plus which I have chronically live with   the illness be simultaneously genetic disorder and environmentally influence   disease hence psychiatric condition be refer as either disorder or illness to the exclusion of the nature nuure controversy   as stress and    trauma impact on one with the genetic disorder of bp   environmeninfluence
I suggest look up mindfulness it be a technique therapist use for anxiety and I be sure it would be helpful in your situation when I sta to feel uneasy about s situation I pull out some play doh and get my mindfulness head on I focus on the play doh and smell it feel it squish it rub it against my cheek etc it be about focus on something else I have even do it with a tissue a really simple version but a bit more invasive be colour again a way to really empty the mind and focus on   specific thing there be lot of resource on the net and even app for your phone all the good
I find it help I greatly when I have post natal depression it calm I down more than anything nd anxiety be all pretty much gonei be on mg ns eventually it poope out because I do not want to up it nd get pretty depressed it do not boost I up anymore bur that be after   yrs
I have not have a manic episode in a while but have be very depressed   I have be isolate sleep eat poorly and drink a lot of beer   I be lonely but do not want to be around anyone   one of my med be seroquel which I hate   I take it for sleep and it be unpredictable   most night I will sleep for two hour wake up eat all kind of junk and then go lie down for hour wait for sleep to come   it be horrible    but it beat a manic episode   I be in the doctor office right now wait to see he
do you keep a mood journal it can be a great way of keep track and you may be able to avoid those bad situation you mention I know a great thing to stop I from spend all my money into put my credit card into a bucket of water into the freezer you have to wait for the ice to melt before you can use it and by that time the urge may have stop I hope you can weather this episode try and sleep if you can take care
selfawareness be extremely impoant when fight mental illness you can get through this cycle and you know it ride it out and think twice at every turn avoid regret you can do it
no one will ever understand what we go through every day then we have mania when we feel we can accomplish anything then bang the depression set in it be soul destroy all I ask for be to be normal even with medication I still struggle
I have high anxiety drive just local I get all work up to just drive to work which be maybe a mile or a little over   I hate to drive I even get work up be a passenger at time if I have to go out of town it be more common then people want to admit I hate drive and it be so hard for people understand how my anxiety get there be some crazy driver out there which do not help
mg all the way down to none I have constant anxiety
my doctor tell I that ssris be bad for my hypomania   I be on latudahelps valium and neurontin for panicanxiety help and seroquel hate it for sleep   the seroquel put I to sleep for maybe   hour and then I wake up and eat everything in sight
it be horrible   I want to try and get ambien when I see he on thursday
at mg I have a lot of irritability and agitation my daughter do not even want to talk to I my doctor put I on   mg and most of it go away
agitation anxiety mania that drug do throw I from depression straight into high level hypomania and mixed state I be fairly ceain that be the drug that land I in the hospital
that suck because same thing happen to I be on the mg for less than   week ans I could not even tolerate itrage agitation and bad anxiety be not sure whether the dose be too small or just it plain do not agree for mein the past pristiq and effexor work ok so think this one would too
I have be on mg and now on mg occasionally get anxiety but nothing severe unless I have not take my med cymbalta be to treat both depression and anxiety from what my gp advise when I be first put on it though
I think much of of this fear and loathing be base on the horrible stigma of mental illness I hate be bipolar also but we have a sickness that people professional include and science know so little about so we be poison with medication to survive in an unwelcome world like leper
we all have our struggle and story some like to share and some find it to hard to try and begin to but we must be strong and keep the faith and hope for guidance to get through we can and will be determined to continue people   love and blessing to all
not sure what we be all suffer here but I have hear it say those with anxiety be pretty empathic so can help other but o always find help myself be a whole different ball game
do it no matter how scary it seem you will be glad you do
talk to someone be the big good first step   think of it as sta a journey towards a happy life see it as a bright light think of it as the good wish you could ever wish for get someone to take youesco you of get out of the house or the journey be the thing you fear please go   find the help and suppo to go talk to someone on the phone while you get ready and go   to encourage and suppo you over the phone if no one can help you go in person
I recently decide to go back to therapy the first one do not fit but I love the second one so remember you choose who you see and not the other way around if it do not feel right keep look for the right one I spend way too much money on the wrong one in the past who do not listen to I or what I want or need but they really can help with your anxiety good luck
I go to a therapist once a month and I still have a panic attack the day before and right up until I be sit in his office
I have anxiety issue as well I use to have panic attack think about go and not sleep the night before now I look forward to my friday morning session my sister in law try counseling and do not feel comfoable with her counselor   find someone different do not just stop go sometimes it be trial and error to find the right fit
I have panic attack on my first few session but now I be stae to feel comfoable so it be okay remember that they be professional in that field and probably have see a lot of people have panic attack so they will not see you as someone weird or crazy say this because I think panic attack get bad when you control it because you do not want other people to see it so tell yourself it be okay to have panic attack afterall that be the reason why you need professional help
go do something to occupy your mind and stop think   about it so much it be only a thought let it go you look back in a week and I think how silly for you to think that this could cause you anxiety or stress it will pass
I have the exact same anxiety and I be so happy once I make the decision to go see someone you will be happy you do also get a journal or at least a piece of paper and try to write down whatever you be feelinggoe through and what aspect of your life be factor in your mental health try to remember everything when you know you only have   minute or an hour or whatever sometimes make I feel pressured
I worry myself almost to death when it be time for my   mo appointment then I feel so relieved when it be overi have no idea why this happensbut every   mo I put myself through a world of worry   hang in there I know how you feelyou will be so relieved when its over
just remember they be here to help and they be not judge   you it be not a test   they usually help you to learn how to manage it and it can be very useful opening up to a stranger I have cbt and for I it do wonder    hope all go well x I suggest take some rescue remedy can be find in most pharmacy it really help I settle my anxiety hope this help x
panic attack sucki be so much well nowi be really bad at one pointseveral trip to ercould not drive could not go eat outdid counseling and it helpit teach I how to control themtook clonzapam since now I be off and on xanax as neededstill have my klon thoughdo the counselinggood luckso glad I be get over that crapbut the fear be still there
I have just have to have my esa assessment hate every minute of be in there I have also get to go to counciling aswell as a psychological assessment so in the same boat and seriously worried about it all have I do enough in the assessment etc I hope that I go ok for both of we
do not worry I also have anxiety and panic attack my counsellor be amazing they let you go at your pace heshe will be there every step of the way for you tell they how you be feel at that precise moment they will not make you do anything you be uncomfoable with or stress out with after all they be there to help and guide you take care and good luck x
I find counsel a god send and a relief just keep tell yourself this be a good thing if you do have a panic attack they will be able to talk you through it which will be helpful for the next panic attack
always know that anxiety and depression frequently hang out together
I stae    low   on quitipine      now   I be on      at night      this last mounth I have become so I will nearly   be addmite    to helston hospital        to day    I have a med review    as   I still need help     I get to say    my doctor   and   my care worker     help I good as they   can     never lie to they be as oniste   as you can        and to all you other    be horrible    to this person    who need help not you stupid    fucking judgment
I understand exactly how you feel I would sit and listen to my dr drone on and on about medicine I be take and the dosage I have be thru a gambit of drug with no success finally I get angry and tell the dr I be not a test dummy to give I something that work I just want to feel well I believe I scare the dr because I yell so loud I tell he I need he to listen to I because it be my turn to talk my appointment run over but he get my message I be not cure but I be do one hell of a lot well   I move into an apament   year ago and still have unpacked box in the kitchen I use to be a bundle of energy now nothing seem to rattle I because I know ill get to it eventually
sharon who be suffer from his   I be diagnose with anxiety that be pa off why I need to talk to someone I love now since I be finally cancer free I do not get quite so anxious any more it feel terrible to suffer from that

I can not go too far from home or I get panicanxiety bad    I have to take valium   neurontin to go anywhere in a car
I suffer from the same I try to talk myself out of it but it be very difficult I hope you find a way to tackle this I know how terrifying it be
agoraphobia boerline personality disorder bipolar pt disorder and degenerative disc disorder be what my everyday be fill with disability at the age of   child suppo and total of   for food no phone to make or receive call no car to make it to dr appointment for phycologist gastrologist neurologist counseling and family pa   the only thing that get I through every moment of the day be the positivity I try to surround myself with it be very easy for negative self pity to sneak into our mind as soon as you realize you be think or be negative smack it down with something anything positive make small goal can not take a shower because it be too scary wash your face or even just wash your hand chin up buttercup
I be sorry I do not have a solution for you but you be not sponge and you should have feel ashamed to ask for assistance or help you need it in order to get well I be in the same situation and it be so hard some day I wish there be more help for those with mental illness worry about have a roof over your head or stress do not help when you be ill do not lose hope when thing get bad I hope thing get well
you might want to ask your doctor about be bipolar you sound manic with anxiety to I I be not a doctor but I have bipolar do you have reckless behavior the shopping thing we know do you have mood swing be low and depressed not want to get out of bed do you go into an extreme high on life like you can do anything   these be all trait of bipolar I have bipolar   with depression anxiety ptsd from abuse as a child please make an urgent appt with your doctor also keep a thought journal account for your spending any racing thought sleepless night and eat take to your dr there be a questionnaire on bipolar disorder they can give you
unfounately I find myself feel the same way be able to not only find something I like and be able to actually buy it I have something I have never admit to but I find myself shoplift I have since dec stop that ilegal habbit still struggle everyday with do absolutely everything I can to give myself at least one positive thing or think a day good luck to you
it sound like your agitating and highly anxious which be understandable hang in there the clothe will not hide how you feel
this be what I staed to do before my   manic depressive episode I be not try to diagnose you but if you have a regular psychiatrist please talk to they I have chronic depression for five year and as the stress build up while prepare to teach a class of my peer I finally have to be commit for two week for my own safety your upcoming trial be definitely more of an ordeal then mine I wish you well and pray you receive the help and justice require
I do the same with a supply   I have so many sketch book pencil markersyou name it I have it   it make I feel so good to get these thing but then I crash later when I have trouble use they or can not find inspiration right away   you be not alone   I almost have a panic attack at the grocery store tonight just because I know my money be really limited but I need food   I be lucky my mom be with I because when I get in the car she distract I with chit chat and I calm down   anxiety be a booger but you be hear and you be alive and you be share with we   good luck with the trial   will be think about you
its mania get some rest   get a hobby and avoid stress no drinking
try mindfulness there be plenty of resource on the net and I think there be even app you can download that can help to focus your thought and attention onto thing that be more helpful I would also speak to your dr keep a mood journal that you can take to your appointment as it can help with diagnosis and be there so you do not have to stress about remember everything
it be really normal to avoid think about big difficult upcoming thing with compulsive behaviour like spend
I use to do this you be try to find thing that make you happy or keep your focus away from at the stress and overwhelming emotion get yourself pretty thing give to something to do and you feel good do it at first the main thing be to try and find other way to suppo maybe work out go for a walk with friend colour etc something you like do that might not cost money but will distract you
this be wise advice for this individual when I be distressed I sta spend money so what you be tell this person to do make sense find alternative that give pleasure without spend money in the end I staed to go swim I find this a great help for calm I down that may help you
it sound like you need to work with a therapist to address your anxiety medication will not solve feeling of insecurity and you may be think it will your symptom do not sound like bipolar but have your dr do a full assessment bipolar depression and regular depression both suck and can last a long time if not manage effectively
I understand I want to be normal so bad   tired of the pill that do not work well tired of the being exhaust from the struggle of keep my shit together    see a dr if they help even a little it be well than what you have now    good luck
you have an illness that be try to run your life and make you miserable   be you on med now   in therapy   if not please try to get help   depression do not need a reason
you mite try lexapro for depression alprazolam for anxiety and seroquel at a low dose for the bipolari have panic attack all my life   its inherit   but there be nothing well than have a liltalk with jesus if you be a christian or whom ever you be high power be I choose god
lithium for depression bipolar disorder   work well   I be on lithium from age      last year I change to lamotrigine for depression bipolar disorder    quetiapine for sleep    lorazepam for anxiety   these   work wonder
I agree   lithium have be my wonder drug   research it   I be on the low dose   it sound scary but educate yourself on it and you will see it differently   I feel like it have give I peace in my life when I have never really know what that feel like
I too be bipolar but I have bipolar where the manic episode be very similar to yours boundless energy and no patience have to make sure house be organize and clean etc there be a lot of med out there but the one that help I most be the mood stabilizer call lamotrigine it even out your mood I also take busparone to help with the anxiety and it really help I be sure to see a psych specialist to get a proper diagnosis if you can not afford one check for free or low cost mental health clinic in your area or call   in any state it be a help line to help you find service in your area

hi this post be from I just an update my gp refer I to mind mental health service I have my telephone assessment today and after foy minute on the phone the woman tell I they could not help as soon as I tell she I have notice I have have symptom of mania she say she will have to consult her supervisor because they only provide therapy not diagnosis I get that but she think I be not fit for their service because she do not think I have just get depression what happen now I be back in square one just feel upset because I be getting send back and foh
sound like you could hav bipolar   and go through hypomania episode but I would not consider what you   describe as be full blown mania as you be very aware of what you be do and during a mania person   lack of insight into their behaviour and believe it be appropriate within give situation when it be very obvious that be be not to other people   mania   do not   equal feel good happy   or on top of the world which many people be say here   you can feel like that but   characteristic be lower of inhibition impulsive reckless and sometimes dangerous behaviour or place yourself in dangerous situation feel invincible   really uncontrollably excitable energetic or agitated irritability racing thought anxiety think you know thing other people do not paranoid belief psychotic symptom include receive special message believe you be special power etc   having say that if you go through cycling mood every few week you should see dr as this more like bp
you be in a manic phase of your depression and everything you have say make sense do not worry the doctor will fix it and when you do crash it will not be good I wish you well you will be fine   I know your brain be race as the previous lady say go to the er it be very impoant you get help quickly
thanks lisa I be begin to panic as I think this be hypomania too my diagnosis be bp I be stae to think I be bp
well could be either I be not claim to be a dr I be first diagnose bipolar I last year now I be be tell more likely bipolar ii bcuz the mania be not as severe and they be more depressive spell I be however hospitalize once   yr ago when I be just very upset but like I have never feel invincible or do anything more than depict above but could be either for I   or this person to clarify either way I empathize
it all seem overwhelming there be medicine that help and it be a long journey get it dial in   even then you will still have failure   it be about a willingness to get up more time than you fall down   everything else be just background noise   I drive on di road whenever I can and play my music loud truth that be how I find my innerpeace   just get to find your di road       
I think a bipolar be a bear that be confuse sexually and like to play on both team hahaha
that be so true but most people we be not sick shame on they
that be I every day   no matter what I do it   be never good enough I try and I fail at least my daughter can see that I be make the effo to change so I be make a difference to somebody I just have to   see it in myself make   more   positive   change do the right thing   get right   with god be   positive   and   do not   be   afraid to   smile
anyone experience relationship guilt you just can not be happy and vibrant like your paner and know she need deserve someone like thathow do you deal with thisknowing she be happy before she meet you
omg so true my ex would say thing about my anxiety   depression   would put I in horrible position around his friend he use to get drunk be sarcastic   upset I wen I get upset he would blame I cos we have a disagreement do not help he be a narsasist
you blame I for my sickness and you create intense stress to keep I sicker
the high sex drive be a side effect of some medication it happen to I when I be prescribe seroquel I also have obsessive thought I have enough after a few month and ask my shrink to change my med the med I be be weene off of now effexor make I lose interest in everything now I be another step close to be completely off the friggin thing my interest be come back thought be clear but I do have period of deep depression and for some reason I stae cut myself when the sadness be at it be bad I have be also diagnose with major depression something like   year ago but something else be wrong
never rule out you be psychic ability too they often represent as anxiety and occur in people who be empath and subsequently depressed deepfeeler
I have experience the same symptom as well I have a breakdown last year I be in the hospital for   day they put I on seroquel   I be diagnose with ptsd   bipolar major depression and panic disorder   I do not know how I would be without it I be not go to sit here and say how bad it be   because for now I be as normal as I be go to be you be not alone
you know I experience voice call my name also I would turn off everything in the house and then go around to the computer stereo tv etc and listen for sound nothing but I still hear the voice I also have symptom very similar to yours the sexuality spending racing thought all unable to control but I do not think I be aware that they represent something wrong with I at the time that do not mean you do not need care I have severe bipolar with depression and anxiety and take a lot of med include seroquel I be hospitalize x one a legal hold   I have be on the seroquel for   year and have begin to gain weight back after a huge weight loss when not accurately diagnose with bipolar I do not seem to be as sedate as other people mentionbut I be very unproductive in day to day activity I take many medication zolpidem temazepam valium zoloft tegretol hydroxyzine   more and yes med be expensive and have many side effect I agree that major depression be   probably one pa of your diagnosis and you be experience symptom that also still need to be address it be a daily challenge and a continual process never end bs that be your life please keep go
everything you describe be system that we all experience impulsive decision that be not think through the big issue be when we be go through an episode we do not recognize it serquol have help I recognize when I be have an episode I have be on it for over   year it take about three month for the medication to really get into your system and not experience the side effect I also have to take sleep aid due to obsessive thought nightmare and
I take seroquel also   mg at night and   mg as need during the day for anxiety and diazepam as need for depression and anxiety   I be not happy
I use to hear voice but it be my own I have bpd major depression social and generalised anxiety   but you could have anything between bpd bipolar and schizophrenia
when bipolar go from paranoid state into psychosis the usual hallucination type stuff roll I doubt your diagnosis be go to change as you be present with bipolar   manic trait and instability of mood keep work with your doctor thing will settle down soon enough
the seroquel give I severe anxiety and odd dream be off of it for   year and still suffer with anxiety and depression
I be diagnose bipolar major depressive disorder general anxiety disorder do and be staed on mg seroquel I only take it for about mo because it cause weight gain and make I sleep constantly it be take about a year to find my right combo of medication but now I be do well on they in addition to therapy current med mg lamictal mg wellbutrin mg buspar mg klonopin and mg ambien

schizophrenia display symptom of depression as well as psychosis audio hallucination be common and may explain the obsessive thought and impulsive behaviour mdd have a psychotic symptom allowance but you do not tend to come across psychotic mdd patient that hallucinate bipolar type   I believe would explain the depression impulsive symptom and the psychosis
hear voice be common symptom of major depressive disorder and also severe anxiety once you feel well you will not hear it anymore but your other symptom do sound like symptom of bi polar disorder
I never say anyone be a liar it be entirely read in some therapist have a view that their experience be all the knowledge need to work with other take a theoretical approach while its true that someone with mdd do not commonly present with audio hallucination it do not mean that a specialist who work more within experience than theory would not contradict that statement and say that people with mdd do get audio hallucination because in his experience he have treat many mdd patient with psychosis so which one be correct neither because both be right in their own scope theory be usually more about general psychology so this be generally true where as people learn from experience have their eye on a specific population and have specific intrest mean they do not worry about general information but information specific to his client

he need a good psychiatrist the most prove med for depression and anxiety on the market for kid be fluxotene
keep do what you be do by encourage he to do even just a couple of thing a day let he know that you be always there if he need to talk and that there be help available if he want it encourage he to write thing down let he keep it private if he want or tell he that if he can not talk but would let you read what he have write it would be a great way of communicate without that awkward barrier of be a teenager vw
come from where he be I would say practice self love for yourself if you two be mean to be then time will tell at some point you have to decide if give your all be healthy for you he need now suppo but it come from medical professional he be unable to make life decision and he may push you away bc he feel like let you go be love you I know that be why I do with so many in my past he be do what he need for himself right now and I understand all the investment you have make for your relationship but you must also decide if give be good for you you must self love first then love someone else I have push my husband so many time to divorce I bc I feel sorry for he he be now learn self love and my guilt have lessen when I see he care for not just I but himself it be still a struggle most day but I do put he first at time to even our relationship no codependency anymore I hope this help god bless you for your redhea and for love he now it be time to love yourself and that will help you decide what be good for you too not just he
if you can handle he at his bad and you really want he then hold on its a matter of time hell come around if you leave he he be go to be hu and not want anything even commit suicide do not pressure he one thing for sure he will come around
I agree with jennifer tenhagen I feel for this man because I be in the same boat year now I have push people away because I feel unwohy   and I can tell you now   pressure he will make he push more and piss he off he need time to breathe and think and focus on his health if he do not want visitor right now   respect that I have have people try to talk to I   pressure I force I out the house it just make I mad   all the question and they annoy I   I just want to be alone in the silence for a bit he will come to you if and when he be ready
he could be push back because of his depression or anxiety I think it be very impoant that even though it be a very difficult time for that you understand that it be not the right time for he to make a decision he might very much love you but do not want to put you through the heaache of what he go through   push you aw as you away because of that I think too that give he time   be suppoive and love he will see that you be truly there for the long run who know maybe that be what he need to see good of wish for the both of you
I do not have mania but citalopram be work for I for anxiety and relate depression I be put on seraline during my recent episode in decfeb which should do the same thing   serotonin increase   but make I much much bad I go straight back to my gp and go on med I know work for I in the past there be so many medication and so a degree of experimentation give everyone with brain illness be different we can call it the same thing bit we all experience these illness slightly differently and of course some bad than other it the same for the med be you try other thing that be non pharmaceutical to try to manage your symptom   for example meditation therapycounselle etc see related web site and   resource at                                                                     and                                                         
I currently take abilify and find it to work wonder for my manicdepression but currently still have issue with anxiety
everyone be different   they put I on a combination of medication to help with my depression anxiety and add   they work well but they may not work well for you   do your doctor do blood work to check the level of the medication in your system   or maybe try genetic test that look for ceain gene that resist med
you might ask your doctor about cymbalta I be the close I have ever be to happy when I take that medication do wonder for anxiety too
I be on mg of that great stuff nail my stress and anxiety problem do make I drowsy though but woh it
I currently take mg diazepam and mg of quitiapine as need for anxiety and depression episode   I have try many different med and these seem to work the good please take care and good luck to you
I know this might sound silly but when you get like that try take a really hot shower while listen to some music just make sure it be upbeat feelgood music that usually help I when I get to feel all pissed off and crappy like that and do not just stand in the shower that give your brain the oppounity to dwell on whatever make you mad wash your hair shave brush your tooth etc anything that will keep your mind focus on something other than what be go on in your head
let your family n friend know how you be feel but also know it be okay to feel how you be feel but also know that you be not guilty or defeat even though you feel that way you can get through this it be okay to have friend or family help perhaps you might let they know how you be feel sometimes it just help to have someone there thing that can relax you can be walk I suggest daytime to take on vitamin d also a nice bubble bath with some upbeat music some find also to like meditation yoga exercise or even cook as relax also take one day at a time you can do this just take it slow you can get through this it just take time be patient with yourself
you need encouragement suppo n love to help you thru thisdo you like to read anger come from avoidanceinspirational book with scripture be very helpful n write in a journal as wellyou be in my thought and prayersdo not let the devil lie to you by tell you there be no hope n that your defeatedfight back n get your life back   xoxo

when it be actual mental illness it be not easy to play on a phone or watch a moviewhy not   because yes it seem easy but our head do not let it be   we be think about what need to be do   why do not I just do it   maybe I can just do it   but if you try you will fail   you be so wohless you can not do this   everyone know you be wohless and stupid   he will even your own mom hate you   do not you see it everything she look at you   can not you hear it in her voice   shit like that and it keep go so yes I may have a netflix show on or try play a game when I should be fill out paperwork for something that will really fuck I up later but my head be talk shit   I be on the verge of cry and try not to so nobody know I be upset because I feel nobody care   it get so bad I be fight myself as to whether or not I should continue waste the space on this planet   and the only reason I be still here be so I do not fucking up my kid   so do not tell I mental illness be be fucking lazy
and I too be a percentage of laziness   with huge bout of un laziness but I can not seem to do those adult thing I always mean to but I do not know y I just do not follow thru until my mum be murder she be amazing she gently coax I from my dark hole other try to push and threaten and give up a constant rock be the most wobderful saviour for mental illness
happen to I lot day when I can not function or go out the door and many pyjama day that sometimes make I feel guilty but it be what it be and I think because I have not be able to work for a really long time I have get no friend and can not make myself find new one because I be not reliable because of a weather phobia so I can only go out spur of the moment which be difficult and hard to have friend when you can not plan   
I still be not sure what be wrong with I but my gp be treat for anxiety but ready this be help a bit thank you
I begin to notice this after my last depressive episode but I also notice it be be happen even before that I would normally push myself but become irritable on those day I be work on that now and learn how to manage it there will be day that I can not though but it be okay I be still stae to learn it afterall
yeah know the feeling about every three day or maybe four my energy zap to a very low point which in turn make I really miserable where I do almost nothing depend on who you talk to will depend on the answer for I I monitor the activity I do and know I have to pace myself or hit a low point that can last for a few day fibro sufferer I stae take vitamin d again and some coq it help to give the immune system a little boost which in turn boost the ability to cope slightly well    I would suggest use something like the fibromapp app ideal for monitoring and you can customise it pace yourself during the up day may also help with energy on the low day if you be have issue sleep whether it be physical or mental pain just chill out if you can the more you fight it the bad it become the energy cycle have many factor lastly have a look into yoga stretching and breathing technique the latter be very impoant to how we heal internally plenty of yt vid around for free the stretching be only stretch no weight or press up etc   just simple stretching technique along with the breathing be a good energy maker throw in some relaxing music quietness and hopefully     minute of this will help a little or a lot
happen to I a lot I try my good to stick to my routine but it be normally be dial back instead of a long run just a sho easy one to get stretch out at least if I want to get   assignment for school do that day I will settle for one maybe two maybe even sneak in a nap I really avoid just let myself veg out all day then guiltanxiety about not get anything do make I shut down again and it become a vicious cycle but keep a consistent and nutricious diet keep a consistent schedule and routine but still accept the day I be not quite superman help I the most also remember to take whatever med you be prescribe consistently too
be deal with exactly this for   year I be on mg arorix it work really well for   yearssaw a psych and he say it be a long process to jump off they and a   week wait after that to get on a ssriso over live with this I never feel happy let alone that joy thing that people talk about totally socially phobicand I be a social workerinsanity

bipolardepressionanxiety open page I just can not pretend that this will ever get well I can not pretend there be a purpose for this torment grief be not a leson it be a feel pain be not there to make we strong it have no purpose mental illne do no go away
hate the way mine make I feel sometimes except the anxiety one that one awesome
ya know I do not even realize my anxiety med might help I chill tf out right now lol thank xd
have you see a doctor you be anxiety and depression may be clinical look for relief in a relationship be a recipe for disaster you deserve medical suppo and a good psycoligistespecially one who understand the college stuff good luck x
hi I be   I have some similar history when I be in college my anxiety be super high and I would miss school due to it I even fail a class because of it and I have no motivation first thing be to just breathe I do not know if you be on medication or anything but talk to someone andor go to a psychiatrist for something be nothing to be ashamed of I could not function without medication literally I use to work at the childcare center at my local community college if you find little pleasure in your work that be okay for now you always need goal sho term and long term it might be hard to find a passion at first I do not know who you be but I have a suggestion try something in the medical field I be in ems I could not live without it I love it whatever you settle for you have get this
heyyo I be   so it be not like I have arrive or anything but a few thing help I when I be feel lose and lonely and unsure about my direction first I think how we have design school and the continuity from high school to college be pretty unfair my mom change career more than   time and she be   now flourish in yet another direction I would strongly recommend take a break semester or two focus all your energy to change up your field from the current job you do not feel joy with do a bunch of new hobby and maybe take up a spo or a a rec center if your job budget allow it I know too many amazing people who be chain to job they hate because they get a degree in something they be not keen on and be now too in debt to experiment travel or sta something new learn about yourself what job you love maybe that be just not childcare anymore I tap out of that gig when I be   xd what job you can not do and hate then build from there to see what you want to do with your day and what kind of job let we you do that then what qualification you need to become the good in that field second nothing make I feel more isolated and depressed than my problematic image of college do not get I wrong I love be in college and have an awesome time but after a high school career of have builtin friend base on who be in my   people class and watch movie about how college be a nonstop pay to find your destiny and make your real friend I feel I be do something wrong when college be exhaust huge nerve wracking and not st all like a sorority movie you be learn how to be a functional adult after be raise in a society that tell teen that their feeling be irrelevant and phasic while also have high expectation and give they basically no life prep soooo glad I carry around a bag of flour for a week instead of learn how to access bih control and that I can do advanced calculus but not my taxis d that pressure combine with the idealistic image of what college isshould be like can make you feel like a real failure it be not true   you be just learn how to stand survive and thrive entirely solo and that be hard and that be ok   third and less helpfully I have also have a ton of issue with relationship often because I speak different love language and have different need nice way of say I be depressedanxiousneedy and have honestly find live alone with a dog to be my answer I do not have an aversive view of relationship and will happily take one up but have just experience from live with paner that I be well in a relationship when I have all the space and independence of live alone it sound hokey but honestly until you have no fear of live and be alone even love it especially if you be neurodivergent or have paicular need paner can and will use fear of isolation to keep you in situation that do not serve you first not even necessarily abusive justif you need they because you be afraid of that isolation they may not view you as precious and may not cherish you the way you deserve it can be tire to be in a relationship with someone who be anxious and I have have some paner feel overentitled to my labor in our relationship because they put up with I fouh selfcare be radical take long bath go for long walk paint sing pet a dog buy yourself flower if you can afford it the world may feel like it be close in and crush but it can wait long enough for you to go outside those be the moment you will really remember the memory you will cherish and the substance that make your life school and qualification be just suppose to open door for you to do what you love not loadstone or something to battle through just for that you get this tldr if you be not sure take a break from college and find your passion then go back to school for that society talk up college so we all feel inadequate regardless what we do there get a dog and live alone alone be awesome d
I say try and relax about thing focus on your school and where you want to go from there job almost always offer little pleasure so do not feel that you need to be in love with your work it would be well of course but hopefully that will be fix after your education be finish you mention enjoy work with child maybe find something that would allow you to continue that interest do not worry about relationship like you say you be   I get marry at   and it be a disaster because I have so little life expirence at the time there be no rush love will happen when it be ready
do not worry about relationship god will send he when he be ready learn to love yourself first maybe you could take elective until you decide what you want to do with college early education be a good field to get in to we always need teacher good luck to you on your journey   
its nothing to be embarrassed about eitheri feel the same way at time and most people do
yes   yrs now to finally have an official diagnosis bipolar   which I refer to as the less of the   evil right now I be struggle and I suspect its because I be so inconsistent with med and exercise please try you will see a difference and trust I we never be bore

I have my alarm set to remind I both morning and night med

seroquel do not make I gain but it make I like a zombielamictal make I sick to the stomach and I be wean off prozac right now and have not feel this good in a long timei be on buspirone now and trazodone for anxiety n sleep and will be stae zoloft on the th
seroquel be the weight killer when I be on it I have gain over   pound in just under   and a half year since I switch doctor and this   take I off of that dread pill and switch I to topamax I have since lose   of those pound and also feel well too topamax be also fda approve as a weight loss aid as it do not slow the metabolism down like most psychotropic drug in its class
I do occasionally have the shake in my hand and the rls symptom at night not enough to make I change my regiman never have the rash
I be on combo of effexor and lamictal as well and it be the good I have ever be however I do suffer from the shake restless leg syndrome and tiredness but have not ever have a rash and this be the second time I have be on this combination
I take   tablet mg and end up in the emergency room never again I be scared of that stuff
lamictal make I nervous and jittery   unable to focus or sit still
I have horrible uncontrollable mood swing I have to stop take it after   week

I be on the borderline of crisis management a month ago quit my   yr job during a panic phase I be shake uncontrollably for   day severe anxiety so bad I would get up and look out window or jump at any sound   could not eat or sleep for   day now I feel grounded
I be bipolar one manic depressant with severe panic and anxiety and yes self love can be do with practice
I use to feel like that I be everybodys first call when there in trouble but when I need suppo no one come because I act strong people assume independent when I be anything but I learn to say no and put myself first by explain deal with there negative emotion when try to help they add to mine like a sponge I soak up there feeling as I be really empathetic this year I tell anyone if thing in there life become toxic or stressful please take my emotional state into consideration before rely on I to fix your drama as every time I do I loose a pa of myself and one day I may be break beyond help it be hard to say but I do it for myself because no one else be ever go to put my need first take I year to realize that x
stop worry about everyone else stop worry about society and enjoy yourself   love life and breathe
society shape your thought and perception as to what be acceptable and what be not we eat it all up like a parasite   then it manifest itself in mental disorder   because the brain and our emotion be overwhelm   so yes society   do you boo
worry about society   no
and that shit be so confusing and race around in your head and   mile an hour and you can not get your word out because it be just too much go on sometimes it be good to stay silent as you say
I be guilty of all the above and it aggravate my family when they need I to remember
I be on both and the memory loss suck I often have complete mental blank that be frustrating and embarrassing but it be just another side effect to put up with for the sake of health
cody cassidy this this be what it be like before I go into depression or anxiety
I find something positive to dwell on exercise faith etc I have stop tell myself that I be go to feel bad and this in itself have help tremendously you will be what you think you be sick sad etc this be not to downplay anyone on medsjust say read all these post will depress anyone
I be worried because this be mw atm and have a wisdom tooth infection only make it easy to excuse not interact with other p hope you be ok reet
this scare I to deathbut I can feel it stae up again   and after read this I just know its a matter of time now I be so tired of fighting everyday already I can not even imagine it get bad again
I avoid have a   relationship due to my depression     not want to go anywhere or communicate with other people   sometimes find it hard to get out of bed or even get out my pjs   get dress for the day its horrible no one understand I I have no suppo
after read this I have realise I have be do all of that over the last couple of week     now I be worry   
I do not avoid ceain conversation I avoid all conversation other people neurosis be project onto my own
I live in this horrible place and it be real bad some day and then it be well   it will never go away unfounately for I but I do have good day and I live for those and my family
please see your gp as soon as possible you do not have to struggle alone   talk to someone about how you be feel there be option if you do not want to see a doctor   maybe lifeline
I hear some ofu say be nice to yr self but when the beast enter the room I just get so mad because I see everything through a different lensso much anxiety I feel like my chest want to blow up
just a question who diagnose these disorder I have usually be diagnose by a doctor for depression and anxiety but people around I seem think I have something close to bipolar I just want it work out because I be the same the high be the good but the low be super flat like I have no hea I be on mg zoloft but it be stop work after   year of slowly up the dose
push people away be pa of the illness there be a lot of symptom in what you say that be very common I be concerned that you be still work though what pa of the world be you live in can you not take sick leave and get sickness pay from the level of stress that you be under I would suggest reduce your work hour I know it be tough but sometimes you need to do it I reduce my work week about   year ago and it have help I no end I would also try and find a group that you can go to say through a charity that deal with mental health you may be able to talk it out with they depression be a dreadful animal and it make you more and more isolated this be a vicious circle I have have depression all my life I have learn to deal with it the good and the bad if you ever want to inbox I and have a chat online I be more than happy to do that
effexor can be a godsend for some people but when mix with other medsor even by itself it can carry a high risk for cause suicidal thought   please talk to your doc hospital have program that help pay for what your insdoe not I use to work in the dept that do that just once you be past the crisis ask to speak to someone in either case management or social work and explain your financial situation and ask they to help you apply for whatever resource you need to cover the remainder of your bill and they will direct you to the right formsetcand if you need help you fill they out I hope this help finance should never prevent someone from get the care they need when they have a crisis my good wish to you
a big dose knock I out   I staed read anxiety for dummy and pray read positive affirmation   very helpful
I take   mg of propranolol x daily to keep my anxiety at bay it do not make I drowsy or loopy or anything   I have xanax for really bad day or day when I have to leave the house
I deal with anxiety on a regular basis I have to calm myself down first then sta my breathing exercise usually go away in an hour or so
I too need large dose of ativan but would forget entire day so I flush they it be scary
effexor I be on lithium for   year but after be attack and not realize the danger fast enough I realize it be the lithium it put you in a state where you can feel neither happy or sad you just do not feel anything   not even fear since the change I feel awake   still have high and low but extreme like they be also realize that all people will disappoint you because there people   I have be on it for   year now
lithium just make you fact serequol make you like a zombie abiify have to watch I take high dose and become confused lamictal seem to be what there push these day
trick with remeron be to keep to a high dosage   unless they be use it for sleep then it need to be   mg also find effexor work great for depression and anxiety add with mg remeron nightly that total my depression and anxiety still have traumatic anxiety but that be getting treat separately
thank you guy I be just so frustrated I just want to be fix I have be have way more bad day then good I have be diagnose with major depression generalize anxiety and borderline personality disorder I take my medicine like I be suppose to and it be not help
mood stabilizer do not get rid of the anxiety or the pd so you do not feel fix that waysome bipolar people have no comorbid anxiety or pd or trauma ptsd or ocd etc so mood stabilizer do make they feel fix most of the time as for the rest we have something else go on most of the timeall the time
you may need a combination just be open and willing to try new med I be on a combo but I be bipolar   with depression and anxiety so I take extra antidepressant
I would not take both of those they be both good but up my anxiety I take lithium and trazadone the lithium do make I a little sick though I know try all these med be horrible and super rough you need medication though keep try  
it be a side effect call akathisia I suggest talk to your pdoc about it it can get really bad it be like restless leg syndrome but all over your body ugh bad side effect ever
I do the same so I do go off all med I think I be handle the daily struggle of life pretty well
my med get switch to lamictal klonopin celexa and something else and I staed twitch too almost like restless leg syndrome I be not sure what to do either
latuda give I tremor hate it they can become permanent do not quit it cold turkey though cuz the withdrawal be horrible have dr help you
lamictallamotrigine be the good medication I ever try I pick it myself it be an anticonvulsant that second as a mood stabilizer so there be minimal risk unfounately I get bad physical side effect after a while but mentally it work I still highy recommend it
there be the text book answer   then there be the personal experience symptom that be unique to each person who have bipolar it be a mood disorder that be unpredictable debilitate paralyze with depression anxiety etc
in bipolar   it can I be tell I be a textbook example but its possible I have both and why not I also have anxiety issue paranoia hallucination score high on an autism spectrum disorder test unofficial but make a lot of since and if I do not have bipolar disorder I would most likely be a psychopath prozac numb all emotion so I do not know if that be how I really be or if that be just the med
same here for   I   it be hard because be diagnose almost yrsi still have not come to term with it   and live in a society where once the word mental illness   be mention   word like mad crazy and nut come to mindi must admit I be a bit ashamed   so I basically struggle on my own    I have stop go to the doctor and take any med   most day be good but   then the low come and I   fight   to feel well it be exhaust the thought of suicide it there most day and   to ease that invisible pain   I need a physical pain   I use to cut or scratch my arm I bite a littleit soothe I   oh my I really need to share so free
full disclosure I have be live with bipolar   disorder diagnose since I be   year old I have my first manic episode when I be   I will be   in may I have be on and off medication currently on they   mg of lithium and   mg of trazodone for almost six year in my   year I have self medicate in the past with booze and drug promiscuous sex stealing driving and behave out of control that be just the tip of my mania iceberg after a heightened state of mania that for I can last month I have debilitate crash low that send I to my bedroom and pajama for week at a time I be extremely founate to have an amazing suppo group in my life that do not let I linger long in either state I still deal with mania especially when I be excited about something and depression not as much these day but I still have a day or two once a month where I be in a funk medication be not a be all end all but it do make my life possible side effect of my med can be troublesome but they be a lot more agreeable than the hell I live through without my med I have amazing relationship with my family and friend no exaggeration herei be a lucky woman on this front a fulltime job that I love and be excited to get up for five day a week and volunteer work that fill my hea and spirit I have struggle to get to where I be today but it be possible to have a fulfilling and functional life with mental illness

avoid sudden change in doseage gradually be well
I like to sleep a lot when I go to bed its like I have turn off all the worry and stress
I have not cut for   year but last week I end up cut myself hope I do not decide to again because of this struggle of get my medicaid reapprove because the state have not yet accept it yet so I can get my mood enhancer so I be not flip shit
yes I know I cry eat I look constantly in the mirror and when I eat I feel upset because I eat I try to eat broccoli and tuna or oatmeal but I also love chocolate too much and I really really want this to stop I can not keep harm myself like this
small stepsbaby stepsit be not failureit may not even be a total relapse   strongsit be never easy when thing get overwhelming
I do not cut but I do self harm by scratch myself   sometimes I do not realize it and sometimes I do   I have draw blood many time and then will pick the scab   my therapist and I be work on it but its really have to break the habit because when I have anxiety attack I will break out in hive and itch really bad   have anyone suggest alternate way to focus your need to self harm   I have yet to find something to distract myself
that be whst I do to but now not allow tattoo so I be struggle again not to self harm
it be not as easy as a lot of people think even excutter some people do not have as much as a daily struggle as ceain other people I know for myself and quite a few other I have meet it be almost an addiction like alcholism or drug for various other reason but it can cause similar symptom when it come to withdrawal etc what you need to realize be this may make it hard for the next few week to hell even month of get back on the horse of no long do it but do not stop try just breathe pick yourself up and sta run after that damn train that leave you behind there be no reason you can not be amazing and great at the moment just shoot for something a bit simple shoot for not cut for a week every week you do not cut allow yourself a treat you do not often get whether it be chocolate special coffee something really simple and cheap once you hit that month mark buy yourself a dinner out tell someone whether it be someone who personally know you or not tell someone who know how hard it be so they can correctly celebrate with you once you hit that six month I do something like alcoholic do I buy myself a token of some so to mark the day then I buy a different one for a year and so on I usually do something really geeky because I be a geek and do something with pokemon and evolution just remember every time you feel the desire there be other way to get the release may if it will help write down your other cope strategy where you keep your cutting tool if you want feel free to message I on facebook I will happily be that person to celebrate a nocutte week with you
look for another job that be less stressful
I have also do this before I be so busy do something else and do not respond to my friend message but I do not mean to make she feel like I do not care I always read her message and it always make I happy but when it be time to reply I get overwhelmed I do not know where and how to sta eventhough I have already respond to they in my mind so I always end up not reply and that make she feel like she be not impoant anymore that I have make new friend and do not need she anymore but that be not true at all yes I have make a lot of friend but it be diferrent those new friend although I value they be not as impoant as she so if you have be there through the hard time I bet your friend have already think of how precious you be but some of we just suck at showingexpresse it and I think it be the same with your friend so I really hope you stay with he he need you more than you think but of course do not stay just because he need you stay because you want to he will appreciate that morei assume since most of we do not want people to stay just because they feel obligated and if you really want to get his attention back tell he how you feel or if you can not tell he maybe ignore he would work that be what my friend do she do not just ignore my message she also unfollowe I on twitter I get so paranoid that time I think I have go crazy thought she be not real that my mind just make she to make I feel well that I think I have a friend but I be actually alone it be terrify but that make I become more aware of what she feel and realize she be not like I who be okay with no communication as long as I know she be thereand she be real lol
really difficult to enquire without put on or seemingly to put he under pressure if in mania maybe want to blot out all thing associate with his depressive episode which unfounately include your kindness you could write express your wish to be there whatever but it be his call and if it do not come you have to understand and respect that try to find out more about the psychology of sufferer a bit more but note we be all different there be no one catchall description of behaviour everyone behave differently however mind boggle to may be to you

I have do this before   I would get manic be hyper active go out etc but would not feel up to socialize with those I care about most   for various reason   you be a true friend to stick it out through the high and low   but also remember be a good friend do not mean you have to feel you bear any responsibility for his well being   sound as if he have not make the leap to medication yet   there will be time when the friendship feel heavy and one side if you need some time so you do not feel burn out take it it will help reaffirm your friendship   it take I until my s to get stable   I be a huge flake due to my anxiety and depressive episode and then everyone would think I be crazy when I be manic and avoid I so I avoid they instead
it replace it for I most of the timeover the last   yrs I have have period of deep depression or where rarely the mania would rear it be ugly head and I would have to take a low dose of   extrelease lithium for a while until thing get back under control I also have fibro ptsd and a blood clotting disorder that can cause stroke severe migraine and blood clot I take anxiety med and cymbalta as well daily when I first go on the topomax I be severely overweight   the topomax help I remedy that in combination with a good diet I lose over   lbs in less than a yrso quickly in fact that the doctor say I would lose too much and make I gain some back p lithium seem to be the only drug I be allergic to alot of other that can fairly quickly help I to be myself again I hope this help good luck to you

I also feel this sometimes though like of course I be grateful to have these medication but I occasionally get angry and bitter that I can not function without they it seem unfair to have to try so much hard than most just to feel like a person it be not that I dislike take the medicine but rather I be bitter that I even have this problem in the first place and if something ever happen to my medicine I would be a total wreck within a few hour it make I feel weak and vulnerable I do not know if maybe this be along the line of what you be feel
I feel the same way I stop take they be take pill for depression and anxiety for   yr now they still could not find the right one so I have the right to give my organ a break but I feel ya about med

lorasapam be a weak drug   they give xanax for that type of anxiety hun   each nerve pill or drug like that be for different thing   zanax be a powerful sensitive   and do not ever just stop take it because this drug can kill you if you withdraw suddenly from it talk to your doctor it take that anxiety right away
sorry to hear that but sound about right I be afraid to go to doctor because I be also bipolar and have bad anxiaty   and they will just say you be fine or just boot you out the door I hope you have a good weekend and wish I have the ancwer you need to help
oh dear my friend I feel so badly for you all I can tell you be about I really I be prescribe lorazepam and I stagger it in the evening for anxiety I take a mood stabilizer lithium x a day and another mood stabilizer at night that be good for anxiety call zonisamide maybe ask your doctor about these drug because my anxiety be under control good luck

you be not alone   many people suffer from anxiety and depression   we feel the same way   see a doctor and let they prescribe you med to take   you will feel well

thank you all for your help and advice it be nice to know there be people in the same position as I maybe when I next meet with my doctor I will not be as nervous to mention it as I be clearly not the only one     I never want to go to the doctor try to self diagnose myself because of the stigma attach to mental health but I figure if I just tell my doctor these minor detail about myself she can point I in the right direction x
please find out if you be bipolar this be very common behavior for someone with bipolar if you have bipolar you can work on a plan to address this behavior you may not have bipolar but if you do you should be address it properly instead of treat depression and anxiety exclusively
I take trintellix for depression work good take time but I like it and ativan for anxiety and other bipolar med but those two be really good
I flush mine down the toilet then cry about how miserable my life be then I be happy   min later lol
I use my phone alarm go off twice a day    you get the good result out of your medication if you take it on time everyday
I set out all my med on sunday into a container and have an alarm for each time of day   no excuse for I   only health
they have lid for your med bottle that actually have alarm and remind you to refill you can find they at your local pharmacy
the key be routine all phone have alarm I use to use mine as a reminder I now have my routine and I never miss it take   day to create new habit routine
my ptsd major depressive disorder severe social anxiety and the catastrophic fallout on my total mental and physical health all make I avoid most social sittuation now I have my doctor other suppoer a daughter a mom who also suffer and a few solid   stable friend but   suppo like this online be also one of my daily lifesuppoe measure at this most frightening time
I seem to feel I be offend people socially and avoid contact make the matter bad
seriously I do   month and I have be so fine I come off med I be currently do another   month after a year to lose the last of it but the   month between dose I have   episode of hypomania so not full blown and no depression with reduce anxiety and that be on no psych med except occasional valium for anxiety trigger ptsd
I have just finish a month woh and just get prescribe   more month and I totally understand how you be feel it have make my bipolar almost non existent well it seem like it no anxiety depression or manic I be think clear and everyone in my family and close circle of friend have say I be the good I have be in   year and only my mother and sister know I be take duromine it be insane I wish there be something we could do to keep it up if you find out a solution let I know please good luck with weight loss and bipolar battle
be careful duramine be speed and can increase possibility of mania my psych will not put I on it because of that fact it be too risky it should not be use as a psych drug it be purely approve for weight loss and not any psych illness I would really speak to your psych about it
my husband have be prescribe it for weight loss but unfounately it be have side effect he be not the same person anymore he be paranoid angry and he be begin smash thing in our house he have no mental health issue before the medication he think I be plot against he and I hate to admit it but I be scared he refuse to believe he have a problem the man I love be now a stranger to I I be make he come to the doctor with I tomorrow but I suspect he will just keep deny it regardless of what the doctor say please think twice before take this medication yes you will lose weight but that may not be the only thing you lose     
everyone react differently to ceain med I do horribly on wellbutrin it make my anxiety bad yet other do great on it
as I say weight loss be initially the reason I be on it the other effect be just bonus at this stage I be only allow it three time a week to avoid dependence   resistance
just because society have tell we that mental illness be a horrible life do not mean it be a death sentence nor should we embrace the label I hate have to wear my mask but I be strive to become strong so that I can take it off I be who I be I be not my mental illness
this be a core question many ask in the depth of their illness the curse be that whilst the illness be real for the sufferer the reality of the actual world may not be as desperate it do not help that we be surround by such a negative medium only repoe the bad stuff of life and the world we live in why do public sector broadcaster in the uk or usa not broadcast positive news the uks big suppoer of those experience suicidal feeling   samaratin   would argue that provide time and space for people with such feeling to talk unjudged and explore they can bring new perspective and outlook to move away from the deep darkest thought unfounately for a very few no relief can be find and suicide provide the ultimate escape from the pain reduce the stigma and taboo that still persist on brain illness need to be tackle in the uk the nhs do not provide the necessary preventative public health work because the government will not find in this area which be the big single health issue affect we socially and economically as a populace we remain in denial out of fear to open up about this many face their daily struggle in silence and isolation there be alternative   dare we fight for they
yes we should fight for they here in america in my town our hospital yrs ago a doctor tell I that here we tend to sweep mental illness under the rug I recently to a razor down my arm   and go deep and long way   it be bad   they staple it back together they be hold I to send off to a mental unit some where   the nurse tell I we do not treat phyic patient here and if you try and escape we will   lock you up in a room well that set I off and I leave without notice and be list as a miss person I have hit bottom once gain   I survive   I be yrs old my illness staed in my early s   anxiety   depression and now bi polar disorder
one because it will not only hu you but everyone who care about you for a long time two because if you do not get it right you will probably end up worse off than you be now be you willing to risk it either way they be the only reason I be still here plus the fact death could be bad you never know
my daughter be the main reason I be still here although I struggle with this question all the time
because it will not always be agony if you stay strong you will have a day so beautiful it will be woh it I stay strong for those day even though every day be a struggle
I be fearfully and wonderfuly make I be I and god love I

I be sorry this be so long but I just post this yesterday as a wake up call to my husband   I have a rantfor those of you who have a friend or love one with a mental illnesschemical imbalance let I share with you some thought    we have real genuine emotionshowever more often than not those emotion be overshadow and push aside when the focus turn to the outburst we may have causedwhile try to express our emotion    the most huful belittling thing you can say to someone with depressionbipolar or any other chemical imbalance disorderis your not really madhuetcyour just crazy you will be fine in a few day you will get over it most of we be well aware we let our crazy show way too muchwe really do not need you to remind we now that be saidis it fair to youthat you deal with these outburst and mixed emotion from your friend or love onenoit noti have no doubt that it be hardand painful I have personally put my own family and friend thru hell and back and I would take it all back if I couldi would fix it every wrong or bad impulsive decision I have ever make just to give they some peace   every day people like I struggle over every single decision we makesecond guess   if we be do right thing or just be crazy once againwe be awaredo not remind we on good dayswe be even able to evaluate the word that come out of our mouth or what be express on fb the point iswe do have real feelingsreal emotionswe get our feeling huwe get angryeven when we be fully medicatedby not validate thatall your doing be push we awaymake we doubt ourselves morein my world personallyi can not handle much more of thatmy mind already run   just try to maintain a ceain level of normalcy
it be a real struggle I have good day and then there be those day that seem to never end I also suffer from severe anxiety so when I be low I be very low but horribly   anxious at the same time I want to crawl out of my own skin sometimes on good day they be awesome and I feel somewhat ok my medication be help but as we all know there be no cure and medication can only help maintain the illness when I be down and depressed I think of the good day and try my good to stay positive by remind myself that this will not last forever take your medication it do help I know not all med be for everyone and the process of find the cocktail that work be agonizing because you be already on edge and be not sure how the medication will work and react to your body it be a process but it help hang in there guy I truly mean it when I say I understand we be not victim we be not crazy we be people who with patience and practice can heal and feel well
a constant struggle with myself no med anymore I be get by   by the grace of god
recently I meet a woman I really like adore feel compassion for and respect and the other day she hu I badly and let I go from my job even by lie to do it I be so hu for this person be one in a million to I I do not take she for grant I do not obsess over she but she be integral in my choice to work there and my happiness there I think we bipolar pick up on ceain quality and characteristic but overlook the reality of how that person can be in the give environment and what we get be not all there be to see we need to be careful
yes when I meet my last girlfriend I feel obsess about she   she be since leave I I still think about she every day and it kill I
or whether it will be a debilitate depressive episode or an extreme anxiety episode
someone offend I at work when I be able to keep a job at   be in the morning I be in a manic episode till   be the follow morning shake with pure irrational hatred
it be more noble to live with your own agony than to transfer it to those that you love it be horrible to say but I be use to the agony I live with everyday so I be well resource to cope with it due to sheer experience with my own emotion to end my life would take my agony and force it into the life of those I love and that simply be not something I be willing to do I can deal with the constant question whirl around in the dark voex of despair in my brain but if I be to stop that happen my mum my girlfriend my friend my colleague would all be think endless thought why do not we notice it soon why do not he trust we enough to talk about how he feel how could we have help he and that kind of rumination be something I would not wish upon my very bad of enemy x
I survive by think every day be a different day I may wake up happy tomorrow live each day a day at a time and do not pressure yourself xxx
because instead of think of your pain you need to think of what it would do to your family and friend if you have kid it change they in way you will never see because you will not be there however we all know the struggle
name of company anxiety girl
no big emphatic no there be no way when I plunge to low that I could possibly follow this advice not a true representation of   how depressionanxietybipolar work at all
yes I see a psychiatrist and counselor but I still struggle
I know the feeling of cut   I only do it   once in a while   I go rock bottom recently and take a razor down my arm deep and long   I have it staple back together I ment it this time I want to die   I have live with anxiety depression and resently be diagnose with bi polar these thing be no fun let I tell you the med I take do not seem to work all the time I wish you luck happinessand a long good life
talk or texte or email your thought and feeling like dairy keeping or indeed talk be all good find someone to talk to too if you think people be scared to listen as many be because it be illness they can not see or often understand tell they they be not as half as scared as you be to tell I be so very founate during my recent depressive episode   to have people around I who listen and do no judge and offer comfo and joy principally my paner the text and fb message and messenger message from people who be not near or dear but who experience of what I be experience and be able to tell   I because I tell they first be a delightfully suppoive surprise ignore gender bias   but these may be useful             and resource section of  
I have a friend I speak with and my husband but he be at work and she asleep and it be not an extreme emergency so I do not want to wake she   and my other social medium account be very dead so that be why I post here and then get paranoid lol   I be pretty open about my struggle so the more I think on it the less paranoid I become I be so sorry those around you do not show the suppo you deserve and need   I be lucky to have a pretty tight circle around I
that be the whole thing stuggle but a hole nother   thing when it come to struggle   alone I wish the stigma of have a mental illness would just disappear what make I the sad be people serounde I closet family   tell I get over it its your own fault your like this and the good oneit all in your head get a grip sometimes wish they could   walk in my shoe for   day just   dayit utter hell if they see this post so what all that will be say isooooop there she go again  
most impoantly I be struggle and I need to say that   past that what will be will be
I be not overly worried as they know I have issue I be a little worried about the cutting pa as I be not as open about my darkness as I be about my other crazy if people read it so be it I guess I be not as concerned now as I first be   thank you again   
well I figure you should know it be a possibility next time tell they you want it to be anonymous when they share a post of yours   it be not really paranoia when it come to social medium it be a digital age and anything can be find if you dig hard enough or spend enough time look just be honest if you be worriedmessage the page and ask they to take the post down
thank you much I get paranoid easily and that help immensely
I always act happy and carefree   but when I be diagnose and go for therapy a whole lot of thing fall into place a lot of thing in my past just make sense I wish I have help when I be young but my mom who suffer of severe depression be to busy to notice I have a total burn out   year ago but my love husband and son have be my rock   but my doctor be amazing as well I have be with the same psychiatrist and psycologist all this time and they pull I through many time it take a while to get my med right but it be fine now I still have manic episode and have learn that it be okay to ask for help even if it be just a hug   if family do not understand it be usually because they be scared that you will blame they   get help go to good doctor and then sit and explain what you feel and go through I take my hubby to counsel with I a few time and it help if you feel alone just check the page there be always someone with love help and advise
you be not alone be diagnose be the first step do not be afraid to share your true feeling put you first take care of you there be a huge suppo system out there good luck  
I go through the same thing since I be   I do research because I know the way I think and the way I act do not feel normal to I as I see everyone around how they be I get diagnose   year ago and I be right that I be bipolarit be a scary thingthrough that time my mother would tell I you be not bipolar just because you look at stuff on the internet and when I get upset she always threaten to put I in the hospital and always call I manic now ever since I be diagnose she ask question   time and never talk about it since so I feel yougo talk to you be doctor because if you feel it you might be
I would go intricate here but in a nutshell but feel free to ask or direct message I   if a paicular batch of people be not tamper with the reality and offsetting of polarisation in the world and people which be accompany by severe sociopath and narcopath the pole of energy that make we up would not be confuse nor would would be in a orchestrated narcissistic world   alone and isolate one must find solitude and within oneself serendipity and contentment even if no one innerstand you   I find several major puzzle piece to what be go on and the deep mechanic that unveil and expand and repair our consciousness mind and body somewhat   anywhoo wholeness infinity   listen to what be the matrix by secret energy np on soundcloud
live with depression anxiety and whatever label you want to give mei just reach this point of understanding   for I I have to go through many many year of med and therapy that do not actually fix the problem   I have be think heavily on this and really find comfo in your post because this be the first time I see another person who have this understanding
clearly many people who comment here have first hand experience of brian illness have a look at the resource page on a developmental web site I be create with contributor below   ignore that they be direct   at man it be just man struggle more to talk about their health and perceive   weakness      see see resource page at         and
I be incredibly alone and lonely in my psychiatric illness of bipolar disorder borderline personality disorder generalize anxiety disorder and post traumatic stress disorder with permanent shoterm memory loss since electroconvulsive therapy in   nobody understand all of what I experience I would not wish any of it on anyone I have research it all I thus know a considerable amount about such illness even borderline personality disorder I identity with you
well look no fuher plenty of friend and advice here you say you be go to the doctor you will have quite a bit to say no doubt make sure that before you go you write everything down do not matter how trivial some thing may seem you can always edit your note later it be so impoant be your first visit that you give a good understanding of your situation most of all do not be afraid I know you will be anxious but think of this as the sta of your new life I hope everything go well for you and keep an eye on this pageredhearedhearedhea
I say that I be not a proffessional but just get to let that anxiety out go to a place or do it in your house in your room and take a deep breathe and then let it out as a big loud scream that will hopefully help you feel a little bit well   then you have get to be strong and bring yourself to look for friend that be willing to listen and respond to your question I know this will be hard but it would be good to find a therapist that will actually listen to you and give you her proffesional out put   sorry if I mis spell any of my word I I would rather keep thing in than go to a therapist and have they tell I some stupid excersize but like I say you look like you be really suffer
I hold my breath when anxiety attacksughhh
tricia leanne cordell because my anxiety bother you   I like this aicle
very true with people that have depressionanxiety
accord to my husband depression and anxiety be thing people allow themselves to have and they should just not allow themselves to get that way it be just a cop out to get out of thing
can n relate big time   panic station everyone get to your panic station   
it be strange how all my anxiety just disappear when I go high I have bipolar by the way if anybody read this and think I be on illicit drug
hey my paner be like you he have bipolar as well as depression and anxiety   he often in his low get drunk for long period of time and say he do not want to be together and the next day say he love I then say do not want to be together etc what should I believe that he love I or that he do not want the relationship
I think I have outgrow my anxiety but I guess I be wrong
a lot of these be on point   I relate the most to replay conversation wonder if I do something wrong when someone do not respond right away beat myself up constantly and fear of mistake    my anxiety in my opinion be the one thing out of   thing I have be diagnose with that I just can not get a handle on at all   therapy have help my depression and self harm with add med but I just can not get the thought of be a massive failure and screw up to stop   that and the suicidal ideation   constant thought of everyone would be well without I and I be replaceable
I get how you both feel because I do as well people with anxiety really need people around they that try to help they because I have feel the same way about everyone would be well off without I from time to time and its hard because if you honestly do not have it you do not understand how it make we feel they only think they know
we should    I feel very alone in this process of try to get well most of the time I can not seem to find many that understand and can not shake the stigma associate with depression mostly
I could have just write that scary I feel the exact same thing we should talk
live with mental illness please check out my blog there be much insight on my struggle and way to cope
  and   be daily struggle
you might not realize it but through the everyday struggle you endure I see a brave and strong woman who think she be on this journey alone she be not even when we be not together   I be mentally by your side hold your hand and whispering   I believe in you   love you your   fan
on the verge of a nervous breakdown but force to go to work and forbid to take a day off for   month
anxiety squad assemble   I swear some day I do not get out of bed unless I literally have to food coffee toilet etc and one thing go wrong can break my happy mood like a pin on a balloon
yep anxiety be not stress it piss I off too
therapy help sometimes you may go through a few therapist til you find the right fit   for you   I only take mg of lamictal and mg of noriptyline which I be prescribe for a nerve in my face but it also work for depression which I have severely right now it be at bay which I be greatful for if you believe in god you can talk to he that have help I alot but everyone be different I have social anxiety but not take anything for it right now
along with med I suggest add some vitamin and mineral I struggle with severe depression for year and feel like vitamin b   save my life it can be find it in a pill form or you can have your vitamin level check and get injection some people like I do not absorb b correctly so injection be the only method that work for I I also recently stae take magnesium tablet which have greatly reduce my anxiety I hope thing get well for you very soon   
let she know that there be several people in this world who care for their love one   she he just need to open up about herself to they and I m pretty much sure that they will be patient listenre and they will listen to watever that person have to say and I say so because a month ago I have meet someone with same thing I will not say it as a disorder because it seem like a disease but I feel it be not so everyone have flaw and no one be perfect and their be someoe to accept you in that way   I m someone who be fill with completely trust issue and I do not trust even myself but I m try to change just because of that one person who come in my life as achange I want to be around with her everytime but I lose she because she find someone else   and the only reason I lose she be because someone else be a well listener and compassionate towards she if you r have this anxiety depression then let I tell you accept it as a fact and wear it like an armour so that no one in this world could hu you again and agin by say that you have a disease its a rare thing to have   I have only come across one person and she be almost as close to I as like my mother   but I believe she be unique as she make people feel special and so I believe you r asweel   people be there to care for you and talk to   its   o clock in the night and I m still awake I have not sleep in last   day   and it always happen to I that I suffer from insomnia after every fonight   I have lose my lullaby so if you have someone who love you and care for you then just do not loose they and talk to they because you can not bear the pain of loose the only lullaby
your med may need to be adjust I be treat for bipolar with anxiety at one polarity and depression at the other I take two kind of mood stabilizer one an atypical zonisamide that emphasize anxiety at nightmg standard dose then lithium mg slow release x a day then atypical ziprasidone at night for sleep I have a benzo as need for anxiety at nighttime this combination work well for I
I have have depression and anxiety from about year oldalthough   my depression have never be too severe at time it have define I now I try to be in charge of it and quite a lot of the day kit work you can still have bad daysjust try to go with it as tomorrow really be another day you will get there seek all the help you can get from your gp and psychological therapy you will get to a well place all the good
you definitely need some different med and some strong dose to stop the monkey gym that be go on inside your head drive you to chaos the noise in your head need to be turn way down and medicine can do that I suggest slow release lithium and an atypical anti psychotic like ziprasidone another great mood stabilizer be zonisamide which have an active element for anxiety zoloft take in the morning at a low dose with this combination be like a good sprinkle of salt for depression too much and it can cause depression or mania but mg be good finally counsel
if thing do not get well look at the med I be now on I use to take effexor but ultimately it do not work for I I would really like to to see you try a mood stabilizer and lithium be the good although the name sound harsh I know it be be such a great for I deal with depression and anxiety good luck honey
thank you the med be just adjust I take effexor rx mg clomipramine mg I also have klonapin and hydroxozine for anxiety and panic attack and I be see a new therapist tomorrow will he my third visit
thank for share our story everyone please feel free to share our story this be avoidable for our daughter our daughter be   and have be stable we beg and plead with our propey management to do the right thing and to take our daughter mental health into consideration it be so impoant to have a stable and structured environment for her   day be in a hotel or with family with hotel be book be far from the life we have provide for our kid especially our daughter who need this lifestyle to make her safe
only be on it for mth but no prob with sweating be shake as in hand leg or head an issue for anyone as this have be a huge problem for I at the moment
when my hand get sweaty it be the first sign along with shake of a panic attack but this staed way before I stae effexor I have not notice any bad sweating after stae it
there be so much help out there so by take the first step and   ask for it   you have staed on a journey of hope from personal experience I know its not a sho journey but the doctor psychiatrist know how to help you so do not feel anxious about meet they you do not   have to deal with this alone so all the good
I agree that you need to see a psychiatrist and try medication I suggest add some vitamin and mineral as well I struggle with severe depression for year and feel like vitamin b   save my life it can be find it in a pill form or you can have your vitamin level check and get injection some people like I do not absorb b correctly so injection be the only method that work for I I also recently stae take magnesium tablet which have greatly reduce my anxiety I hope thing get well for you very soon   
panic disorder be on the dsm and need immediate treatment as do self harm feeling of suicide be very serious and you need to find and emergency room psych ward right away and tell they you be a harm to yourself and check yourself in and they will refer you later to a proper psychiatrist right now you need a high level of care go get it dear
you need to see a dr to get refer to a psychiatrist and therapist you can not deal with this all on your own look up mindfulness it be great for deal with anxiety although you will probably have trouble do it yourself to sta with but it might be woh check if out while you wait to see your specialist
hi suffer   year with the exact same thing the dr tell I I have gad it be take time   I do not take any med I be to scared   time heal I
I just go through this my mania be so high it be cause anxiety attack luckily new dr recognize this put I on seroquel it be be a godsend
I find if you have a panic attack it normally happen when you sta focus on yourself the fear if you have a fidget toy play a game in your phone and shift your focus I find it not as bad as for the rest finding balance with your doctor need and therapy be definitely
first thing I be so sorry you have to go though this try go to a different dr one for mental anxiety and depression or try councillingor both you need help in deal with this with the right help you can learn some skill to cope with this your reach out be a good thing and a good sign that you want helpjust know you be love and there be people on your sidegood luck to you and let we know how thing be work out it will be all right   redhea

she be in a bad place right now and probably terrify as well the doctor will help she and then she will be a lot more understanding
welcome to the club   it be really hard when our love one be severely mentally ill   we feel like we be get ill too because of the stress of it   I have a hard time with communication when my love one be get more ill also   there be a lot you can read online and there be some good book write also   it be hard for I to learn not to challenge delusion   it be hard to realize that they be ill and to not take their anger personally   when I be a child we have to get my mother to the hospital but we always put it off as long as possible hope unrealistically that she would get some sleep and feel well   my mother would get manic   after she be in the hospital for a while she would say   why do not you get I here soon   but when she be so sick she do not want to go   hang on to the fact that she will be feel well soon although it may be a while   these day they be require to go to group in the hospital and they do get to think about mental health and how to stay healthy mentally   you can go to a suppo group hold by nami for family   that may help you
first of all you be amazing   you do the good you could at the time and her health be your main concernpriority that be love   period nobody like inpatient care especially mental health but she need you and you show up and step up do not doubt yourself on that decision I be so sorry she be suffer and you be feel helpless find a good counselor for you similar to aa people who love those with mental illness need suppo too and that will help you to feel more confident about care for her bipolar be a bitch excuse the language but it be seriously horrid be there for hug hold she when she be panic and help she breathe slow while you hold she remind she that its ok to stay in bed or check out when overwhelmed she be bless to have you
good that you be suppoe she but before that please please try to find out the reason why it all stae what be all be go in back of her mind which be trouble she she might be hesitant to share it easily but you have to find out that rather go for medication I know it be necessary   but try to figure out the reason first   as no one be bear with this illness
give her space and love keep a watchful eye on she do the thing you would do yard workhandle the vehicle throw in I love you a few time but not constantly one of they will get in ask she if she want to go out if only for a walk do not get mad when and if she do not we do not want pressure of make to feel evil and ignorant I lose my daughter dad that way he hover so much I could not keep a thought if I try bipolar we have enough go on I our head to deal with than to be make a monster     good luck truly
I want to sta by tell you I appreciate you want to understand well I have live with it for over   year force my husband to   live with it also like you he educate himself the thing I want to tell you most be we be uncurable we be not crazy it be not all in our head and how can we make some one else understand what we do not for I it be find the right set of medication   this take year continual therapy because the med only help   manage the symptom and even with all this help I still have episode my husband know he can not fix it but he have learn to communicate with I and when not to sometimes we want to be hold sometimes we want to be leave alone sometimes when we lose control we need someone to intervene you do the right thing I be bet when your wife slip into a sane moment she will agree it be not that we want to die its that we just want these overwhelming feeling to stop read research literature because the well you understand the well her suppo team to a manageable life
first off she be very lucky to have someone who be so suppoive so give yourself credit for that   I have bipolar and depression and on my bad day some time my spouse have difficulty handle it or know the right thing to do so I understand from how he have explain it how you be feel I can not speak for everyone as everyone be different but for I the whole push everyone away be somethibg that happen to I a lot especially during episode   I do not want anyone near I I have trouble feel connect to anything or anyone include my spouse   for I what mean a lot to I be that he be suppoive as well and do not give up on I even when I want he to   sometimes even if I want to reach out and talk I can not bring myself to do it so I shut everyone out instead when I be in that state of mind I be ceain that I be a burden to everyone and that everyone will give up on I   reassurance be something I need a lot   I would say just make sure that she know that you be there with she that she s not alone and that you love she and that you will be there beside she while she get through this   she may try to push you away and I would imagine it be not an easy thing to feel but do not take it to hea it be her illness talk not her   sometimes the illness can take control of we I can think of countless time when I be push my spouse away or be mean so he will go away but on the inside I want nothing more than to be with he but I can not bring myself to say those word or to drop that wall that I have up   be stick inside yourself be scary    you be do the right thing by be there for she and she will come out of this redhea
her say she hate you or the anger that be not she speak that be the illness it may not seem like it now but thing will get well she be very lucky to have your suppo and you try to understand what she be go through   I must say you be awesome and you should be so proud of yourself for take these step like some of the other have say just do not forget to take care of yourself as well you can not be there for order if you be tired rundown or overwhelm
you have do the right thing and she will understand in time when she be on the correct med bless you and your family it be a battle but stick together and you will cope xx above all talk to anyone you can and do not be afraid of take help and advise much love to you xx
I have bipolar and depression and anxiety and ptsd its one hell of a roller coaster even with med I feel like I be in a nightmare be there for she let she know she be not alone and that she be love good luck to you sir I hope thing get well

I agree time to go to a doctor I would also suggest it be time to see a therapist as they will be able to teach you the skill and technique you need to manage your anxiety and depression as medication alone will not cure you
time to go to the doctor this be long overdue I suspect pa of your anxiety be the isolation as well anxiety depression be a very isolate place to be you must phone the doctor today and try and get an appointment today in my opinion I would regard your appointment be an emergency make sure you do it it will lift the weight off your shoulder

I think the relationship sound like it could be good for the both of you as life be hard on all of we he might himself have mental health issue if nothing else it sound as if his mom and stepdad be make it very hard on he to make his own decision and if you add that same pressure on he he might be in a type of stasis where he would rather not decide one way or another although he should be more helpful when you be upset who know what he might be feel or think at that moment it be up to you to decide if that kind of treatment be acceptable in your life and you alone if you love something let it go if it come back then it be mean to be   as for what you can do for you be focus on you and your son do not allow anyone to discount your emotion about the fire that kind of event be very tough and you never get over they but you can get to a point where you be at ease with the memory I try to think different about those situation likei make it out and get I and my child to safety obviously I can handle my shit I be awesome and strong therapy be good for situation like this you get a different view on the thing go on in your life you also have a safe place to vent and can get more out than what you just share with we   just remember that many here care enough to try and give you something to go on some kind of advice that hopefully will help and ease your pain even though its facebook and you can not feel our hand on your back to console you in your time of need we all do care about you and very much

I have a daughter   granddaughter   adhd grandson   niece   we be all bipolar it be so very hard to live a life of bipolar illness no one understand what you go through each day as a bipolar person I do not know what to expect from myself each day I wake up I hide my feeling most of the time so no one worried about I I would go to take a shower so I could hide my feeling so many other thing I do if everyone could just try to understand who I really be no matter how much I be love   I feel unloved most of the time
I do not know what I think of that we all want desperately to be understand
I have anxiety and depression and my diagnosis be bipolar largely because of these two polarity if you be act   degree out of character you can suspect manic behavior
it could be a hormone imbalance but it could just as easily be that the frustration have be build up and it be reach it be peak mental illness aside you be only human and it be natural to get frustrate when thing be stressful I do not think it be unreasonable to speak out when all you need in the first place das a straight answer make sure you unwind outside of work and visit your doctor for some blood test to check your level vw
arielle oligny gabrielle tremblay redhea
I have be diagnose as bipolar for   year but be bipolar with no diagnosis for year before that I have feel hopeless so many time even to say a daily struggle with feeling of hopelessness
hopeless sound like low energy and at minimum mild depression by now you may have self confidence and self esteem issue as well and thus some social anxiety be you in counseling be you in a bp suppo group do you get a little exercise have you consider a pet have you evaluate your med with your doctor because it be not normal for you to be suffer
I have have it for   year everyday be a struggle but I have find with therapy the right med and spousal suppo it be possible to make it the old I get the bad it get I just choose to handle it differently
I be diagnose last year and its a struggle
there be strong evidence to suppo bipolar run in family this true in mine without get personal as some member be still alive but a very close relative have just be diagnose get the help now even if your fear be unfounded good luck
as a person who fight suicidal ideation every day and as a person who be attempt suicide quite a number of time throughout my life this post be in a very strange way reassure you get tired of hear how other people will feel nobody seem to care how you feel no one understand the deep hole of despair that be suicidal person be in no one understand the bonechille pain that a suicidal person be always in and how every day be a struggle not to try to kill yourself
it be not the main reason it be just a reason that be a lot easy to hold onto and believe suicidal people do not care about themselves anymore but more often than not they still care deeply about their family it could be why they bottle up all their feeling and let it get to that point because they do not want to worry anyone oh and this be someone be life we be talk about if guilt tripping keep someone alive until they can find a well reason to stay alive that be a success in my book
this be true I currently be one whenever someone say it it make I feel guilty and a lot bad we all know they would miss you but what people think when their suicidal be I have no life that be what be impoant to focus on and this say just that
such a simple acknowledgement but so true you should not   be afraid to do thing in life that benefit you first instead of other people   need to make themselves first which the mentality of the suicidal person be that everyone be above they that need to go
okay but   the only reason I be alive today be because I realize how my death would affect other   it take I year to reach a place where I feel like I deserve to live for my own sake   sometimes in a crisis you do what it take to stay alive   yes it be just a temporary fix but so be put pressure on a bleed wound   if it keep you alive until you can reach a more permanent solution it be valid
guilt trip make you feel like more of a wohless loser call I selfish do not help
when you be suicidal you be in the tunnel and it be black there be no light at the end of the tunnel and it hus and it be disorient and scary and you can even hyperventilate to the point at which you become calm because you begin to think you will kill yourself and sta develop a plan I think the key be faith and not necessarily in god just faith that just as there be darkness naturally there will be lightness very soon and you can withstand this pain that will definitely release you when the light in the tunnel enter and it will at this point you will breathe well think more clearly and positively and walk away from the black spell you will have miss a bullet and get on with the rest of your day sometimes it really be just an analogy to help your head survive
I have never know a suicidal person that be think rationally it be a deep deep hole where self woh do not matter and they have even come to the point that they think their family would be well off without they I have feel it and I have see it I feel very confident in this belief no it be not a selfish act   and that be a horrible thing to say but in those moment the logic of understand what the life of a survivor would forever be be a big deal and care about those other people be a lot easy to do than to care about one self they need suppo understanding and kindness but this post sound like an attention getting and not someone so tired with life that they be do
that be horrible   I hate that we have to live with so much judgement even those that be try to get attention need attention need help and they be in danger of thing go too far I hate it
yes suicide do hu love one   it still will never be the way to help a suicidal person to heap guilt on top of their self loathing to try and get they to stop feel the anguish they be feel   would you also tell someone with cancer that they can not die because their love one would be hu   depression be an illness just like any other   endthestigma and stop try to tell depressed people their disease be less impoant than other people
that be the only reason I have not kill myself because of guilt I feel as if it would be too selfish
yeah it boil down to approach there be be encouragment and there be guilt trip suppo not judgement be encourage to think of your love one be not the same as be accuse of be selfish for supposedly not consider they some people mean well other be just asshole
but there be a difference between you think about your family and make the decision to hold on and somebody else throw guilt at you and call you selfish for need your pain to end   try to guilt people into not suffer from a mental illness be just as ludicrous as try to guilt a cancer patient for be sick
yeahyou know you be get realngood at hiding when you can hide an anxiety   attack not the big one but some of the otherd
as far as I know there be pregnancy safe med to take but very very few I be almost   month pregnant be on zoloft the whole time and I have   different type of doctor all tell I zoloft be safe some med be class c and the doctor have to decide if the benefit outweigh the risk they may decrease your dosage or take you off completely and give you something consider safe most of the time stay on your med while pregnant be well for you and the baby you stay stable be what be good for the baby they will watch you closely talk to your doctor about zoloft it be work well for I though yes everyone react different it be help keep I stable with my bipolar depression and anxiety
be that I doubt you have be pregnant or have a medical degree I do not think your feedback be applicable to the question
paul david have write book that help with anxiety they be really helpfully cbt be really good too I wish you well smilingface
he need to see a therapist for some cbt if they can do it via facetime or skype it would be great to get that in then pinpoint what staed the anxiety do he have an attack one day and then fearful of it ever since to the point that it be now become so disable be he a veteran ptsd seem that it be the negative self talk and thought that be get to he right now by not be able to go out I take prozac buspar and xanax when need I know you say buspar do not work but how about trazadone therapy be honestly go to help he in conjunction with the med
it suck I have a social anxiety where ill be okay for awhile like in a mall then all of a sudden get very overwhelmed
ask to try proprananol it be work really well with my anxiety x
desiree rivera   they be class as beta blocker I be prescribe up to mg per day in mg tablet to take as and when need they be what be usually prescribe for exam anxiety and drive lesson anxiety etc but be great for take the edge off a situation like go out and busy place etc but he may benefit from an antidepressant at the same time I see he be try seraline I do not get on with that have you try citalopram x
very down in the dump very scared of have an anxiety attack he feel like a disappointment and embarrassed
take any medicine while try or during pregnancy should be avoid or minimise base on the risk of take or not take the   medication as clonazepam be a benzodiazepine there be a risk that your baby will suffer withdrawal when bear as drug will pass through your system to baby you and your dr need to discuss pro and con of stop or continue I do not think clonazepam have specific risk to foetal development
I take all my medicine for bipolaranxiety depression safely my daughter be   and perfectly fine I have blood work do every month to make sure my liver be do well I also have extra sonogram to ensure she be develop properly I think if you have your obgyn and physchiatrist work together throughout your pregnancy you should be able to take your med throughout   on a side note   if you be stress the baby will be stress as well always weigh the pro vs the con
I take it all through out my pregnancy the doctor say it be safe and it be impoant for I to be stable while I be pregnant than to risk an episode that could be dangerous I now have an amazing healthy three year old son
I be on prozac for   month it be for stress induce seizure I have these side effect I take myself off and cleanse my system about a week and a half later I be ok
it take I three attempt to find something which work seraline the only downside be it give I an upset stomach but the first drug turn I into a zombie the second make the anxiety worse like anything some drug work for some some do not and sideeffect may affect one person but not another if it do not work for you try something else also most med say not to just stop they but wean
typically there be side effect initially especially if you sta on too high a dose but prozac be prove for anxiety and depression I would not give up on it
I have bipolar disorder depression ocd and personality disorder I just want you   know I be diagnose with depression when I have my daughter yrs ago I then go on to realise I have much more undiagnosed but be so afraid to tell my doctor the truth as the same as you be worried about the care of my daughter and to be judge as a bad parent many year go on and I meet a new paner yrs ago and he pick up on it strait away I be in denial although deep down I know something be wrong it get to the point where I have to tell a doctor and in all honesty it be the good thing I ever do as they be so suppoive and could not help I more my child be well look after I tell they as they do have to ask and the doctor and psychiatrist honestly take your word unless they have evidence to proof otherwise you need help and need to confine in a doctor before it get too latei do not have panic attack anymore I do not have anxiety I sleep I do everything I should be do   but I do have   bad day out of say about   or   but it beat everyday life I be so proud of get the help and care I need for I and have help my daughter   you reli should have a think about what be good for your child which mean be good for you take care hun and get some help xxx

be there any cure for bpd and witch be bad   bipolar   or bpd and what be the difference   please   I be confuse     thankyou
I be sorry but we be incurable they truly understand so little about the mind I have live with it for   year and it be manageable with therapy and right med bipolar come with so many side order anxiety ptsd sleeplessness personality disorder
I be the mom and wife to three very functional and amazing bipolar folk medication therapy lot of exercise and my daughter will tell you avoid junk foodthe sugar high and low exacerbate the symptom
medication can get rid of bipolar symptom but then bring on depression anxiety panic attack etc no simple surgery can fix all that
if you genuinely get bipolar it be good to avoid take any drug as it can make psychotic episode go from terryfye to dangerous
actually while weed be effective in treat several mental illness such as ptsd anxiety and depression test show that it worsen symptom in bipolar disorder schizophrenia and other possibly even cause psychosis if you have bipolar disorder stay away from marijuana
I have no idea how to tell someone I be feel like this I be always afraid of they think I be attention seek or something
year ago in a therapy group I be in fine mean fuckedup insecure neurotic and emotional   say we be fine be not allow   we have to learn how to express feeling instead of act like we do not matter
it show the most in there eye then when you try to live with somebody that do not   take there med   if you care about they this embalace can make a whole house in turmoil they will not   addmit they have a problem they just find away to blame it on you it be   sad to watch somebody life that be bipolar if a person be diagnose bipolar it suck but if you care about that person your life will be happy help they to stay on they med be through it for   year
tara sweet   her name be sweetswhen I would talk to her teacher they would always say how the girl fit there name her sis be name be precious I would always say be we talk bout my sweet at home she be always be make I be disabled when they be bear they stay with we from bih I kind of felt cheat out of be a grand pa but I would trade the life I have with they   for any thing they would come home in   and nd grade upset because other kid have mom and dad pick they up so I say they down and watch andy griffith show   I show they how he call his dad   pa I become pa and they never feel like they be miss out on anything I become pa to every one that they new I have kid call I pa I never new but always answer they like we new each other for year to this day   year later I be still pa and well know by one the girl know it be truly be a gift of life for I

I be tell to give myself a shake before be diagnose with bipolar
upon his observation falret notice that anxiety be a pa of rapid cycling mood and   bipolar disorder as be source touch with fire by k r jamison
rapid cycling bipolar disorder be paicularly almost impossible to live with as mania and depression over sho period or even from day to day the mood may even merge as they mix and so we have rapid cycling mix mood there be a link between mania and depression thus with a mixed state mania be depression in a more intense form mania and depression be which be dreadful disease be one disorder   mania can moreover but distinguish from depression by degree and    manifestation jean pierre falret in the midnineteenth century posit that strong depression often occur before during and after mania bipolar disorder be a truly dreadful illness and I have the rapid cycling divergent form with hypo mania which be more difficult to treat I would not wish it on anyone
aftet a thiy year struggle just find a shrink who tell I the only way be a combo of med and psycho therapy have   both before   but not together look   forward   to the next   stage of the journey its all a learning   curve to those of you out there that be still in the acute phasese hold tbe the faith love light and peace
I wonder if you be on the right med mood stabilizer be good for control anxiety and depression like lithium and zonisamide and a benzo and a hobby suicide be no way out it be the absolute end it be give up and I be sure you have not try everything
hi rosalind you be not alone sweethea I be   I have severe anxiety panic disorder and it be be   year since be out in public   I only go to my doctor with my brother by my side and I have a specific taxi driver I have know for   year drive I there and straight home   I have not be to a shopping centre a park a beach   no where   I will not even get the mail from the letter box   I have no friend and no one know I exist I hate when people walk past my house give I anxiety I do not answer the door or phone   I truly and completely know your situation darling and yes it get to feel like your a prisoner my hea hus for you because I know how you feel so much    xxxxxoooo I send you huge hug

exposure therapy be the way to tackle it take someone with you who will hold your hand and then baby step out that door practice deep breathing exercise out there get yourself calm then a few more step do a bit more with each day or do it morning and again in the afternoon it be like a fear of fly the only way be to fly and repeat flying lose the fear exposure therapy dear
my good friend have borderline ptsd schizophrenia bipolar depression psychopathy disorder anxiety and compulsive lie disorder and she blame everything on I my family and her family and daughter instead of take responsibility for her action she keep emotionally abuse we and manipulate we with lie and be very controlling and treat we like crap and hus we she refuse to get help and she demand a break from I because she claim I do not understand all I ever try to do be get she to get help and take responsibility for her action she will not get help and it be hard on I because I be autistic and can not communicate properly I have asperger so I misinterpret social situation and can not always express myself correctly and I get emotional meltdown due to inability to communicate plus I have depression and anxiety so it be hard on I deal with my good friend she just will not listen I wish she would get help and stop blame everyone else for her problem and I wish she could see the pain she be cause I I have cause her pain with my meltdown but I always apologize and try to understand but she just will not it be hard to know what to do anymore because nothing get through to her     people judge I too and reject I when I get too emotional for they to handle and tell I to handle thing myself plus I complain all the time because I can be a drama queen at time so it be very hard deal with this because the autism community have it especially hard because we want to be accept for who we be but instead people refuse to be there and try to change we into something we be not it be just so unfair and overwhelming deal with all the ignorance
some people fear the mentally ill rather than help they   even those who say they love someone who be mentally ill often react with anger and resentment instead of understand   mental health education need to be more prevalent   it anger I to see those who be ill take advantaged of
I be reaffirm a post not sure what you be confused about
I be push my bf away I do not mean to today I be go to tell he what be go on and what I have be think because it have ruin my relationship in the past I love my bf a lot and do not want to lose he over my anxiety I be tired of it try to rule my life
I become obsessed with a thought and I forget to do impoant thing I have to make list to stay on task
I love you and I know it just worry I sometimes
sometimes people over think thing and they give themselves grief unnecessarily have a positive attitude and   good outlook   on thing help to lessen anxiety   
I try off and on for year but it only make it bad for I I have problem with any job I have my emotional outburst would be horrible and my up and down be incredibly painful then I be diagnose in my s while my cocktail have be adjust it work but diet therapy psychiatry and other suppo be impoant too balance be the key
type   and med free for over a year   but I work hard on recognise sign symptom and trigger and still use some medication as need to calm anxietymania if need
I be diagnose in   I be currently not on anything for my bipolar but my pcp just staed I on wellbutrin for my horrible anxiety also have generic xanax my bipolar med make I a zombie and I gain a ton of weight   my family and friend that know I be bipolar have say I be well off they than when I be on they
I try come of med but staed struggle after a week but everyone be different so good luck
I have be me free since   but I be also only bipolar   so I do not have huge mania it be mania to I but by doctor standard it be nothing I have more depressive episode than anything and I be easily stress but I be personally well off like this than I be with med I also do not have suicidal ideology and never have so it be probably easy for I than someone with they   some people it work for and some it do not
once you come off your med it can stay in the system for a bit I be currently go without but that be because I move and only just get round to change doctor   month later I do get very low moment and get a bit worried but I be pick myself up I have find I have seperate myself from people more just want my kid around I and family I be see a ne doctor next week though I guess you just need to be so aware of yourself and any mood change med be not a quick fix and take a while to get into the system xxx
oh and jennifer I think your comment be a little broadbrush yes perhaps it be practically impossible to be   symptomfree but that do not mean someone not take med for it do not have bipolar I have it for   year before I stae take the right med and I get by just fine   but after take antidepressant from my mid s I continue to deteriorate rapidly until I be around   when a correct diagnosis be make since then I have be markedly well but unfounately a lot of damage be already do to myself and my life and that be now what I be struggle with as it amplify my symptom
I doubt that you could be medfree   fully functional long term with an illness like bipolar I I rattle like a bottle of pill when I walk and I still struggle a huge amount be off med can cause a more severe relapse but at the same time if you be med free and cope well because you have make significant change in your life   lifestyle to work around bipolar then there be the potential that it could work for a select few
warning   may be a trigger   if not allow please delete then I must be weak yesterday around   be I could not fight the monster anymore I think I have enuff fight in I but no luck I be so embarrassed for what I do and feel so stupid for do it   I self harm   suicide attempt   I be just put this out there so maybe one person can relate and get the help that they need   call your nearness crisis line or call   please I wait about     hour after I do it   one side of my brain be tell I to call to get the help I need but the other side of my brain be tell I no   I call n get help that I need I be home now under   hour watch for the next couple day    my choice since hospital be a very big trigger for I    sorry for be so long I just need to tell my story   stay strong   keep fight never give up
so true last night I have a severe panic attack where I literally think I be die most people do not know how to deal in those situation my mom jump in and help I calm down and she seem to just know how to be there for I those people be treasure in our life
look at what you do have do not focus on the negative be bipolar be not negative there be some with cancer right now that would trade place with we in a hea beat you say you work full time then that be great some people struggle to find one I do not know much about your life but for I I stae give myself manicure and pedicure I go for walk and just refecte on how I have a job my child be healthy I have a home and food to provide sta think about everything you do have that someone else might not have and you will find yourself rich in happiness
keep search for the thing that work for you and the way of life you need to stop you struggle change be difficult talk and talk to those you trust life can be a struggle but make it your struggle for what you truly need and want sometimes and often its the simple of thing and sometimes not thing at all but feeling   peace calm the mind
I embrace it it be all I have ever know the day I wake up and do not hate everything about myself and do not want to die will be a scary day
set an alarm for the time to take your med even though it be something we do every single day we can still forget
as a medical professionaldo not google med it will just make you crazy anytime anyone have a side effect and repos it it will be put on prescription leaflet and website as a side effecteven if one person in the whole world be the only person to have this side effect you will worry yourself sick about have the same experience knowledge be power discuss with your doctor the side effect that you have experience on previous med or that you have hear of other experience they be there to help you if they be a good doctor that be and will discuss pro and con of the medication I have turn down ceain medication because I do not want to take a chance on ceain side effect after discuss it with my doctor you should never feel afraid to ask your doctor your question different med be go to work well for other due to their genealogy there be test nowadays that they can test what medication would work well with your individual gene structure and have help stop a lot of the trial and error med trial many of we have endure hope this help

I be only on small dose and I have to stop because I fall asleep at the wheel of my car the drowsiness be extreme I could not function I be irritable but I put that down to my bipolar not be stable med react with different people in different way
seroquel give I horribly violent nightmare and yes I experience some aggressive feeling
I have bp   and it be   often miss and diagnose as depression anxiety because most people seek help during depressive phase and these can be more obvious the hypomania a person can come across as be really energetic or irritable and anxious agitated   fixate or obssesse with something and then last for a few week it generally do not involve lose touch with reality or lack of insight   self awareness as with mania the cycling between hypomania and depression be generally more frequent in bp and can be just as difficult to manage because of this frequent mood change                                    in fact to be diagnose with bp a person only ever have to have   episode of mania and sometimes they never have another one
generally type   severe episode of manic at least one and depressive episode   type   hypomanic episode at least one and severe depressive episode there be other type of bipolar disorder that no one talk about it like cyclothymic disorder be a mild version of bp with mild hypomanic and mild depressive episode I have be diagnose with cyclothymia although I feel I be bp at time it feel like live on the edge it frustrate I sometimes I feel I just want depression to hit hard I lose it all but I can not it just make my anxiety level very high sometimes it feel I be hang in midair not sure when I be go to fall and at the same time wish I could fall and be do with it
I get bi polar   and it suck   I also have   ptsd bi polar   severe anxiety   severe depression   adhd suicidal ideation so its hard for I to explain sorry but people on here be do a very good job of explain it
I be bipolar   I have more low than high and my high be mostly irritability with a lot of energy I believe bipolar   be more high than low and their high be extreme
louise thank you I be more manic most the time now but with my med and therapy I have learn to recognize it and try to control it be that I now have many anxiety issue plus some ocd   I be struggle but do my good I just do deep breathing along with walk away from the situation till I get my center again long   yrs it have be   
in simple term bipolar I be the more severe of the   you experience extreme high where thing be completely irrational and severe low where thing could not get much bad bipolar   be not so severe but just as real and hard to deal with
if you be unsure you can call your pharmacy and ask they be good with stuff like that
  see a psychologist a lot can be achieve and I be very cynical through let a stranger into your head psychologist be not medical doctor although they can be also as such but work on therapy by assist with identify issue pattern challenge idea that you be set on etc you may need to see one or two different one before you find one you be comfoable with   do not talk yourself or a doctor into a diagnosis bipolar be normal just an extreme version of normal where your up and down be more common and more severe do not think you be sicker than you be but if you actually be then do not worry because there be heap of different option out there   drug work different on different people some get benefit some do not some get side effect some do not I stop count at about a dozen different drug I have be on over the year to find an improvement and then to fine tune it do not expect the first pill to be the silver bullet and do not be afraid to tell your doctor if you be not happy with something you be on try to document thing as well you can eg feel super down no reason tonight sleep pattern be off feel lethargic this morning I be get xyz side effect etc it be hard to recall everything when you be right in front of your doctor   if you be bipolar then antidepressant be unlikely to fix your problem you will also need a mood stabilizer or anti psychotic not necessarily for psychosis they can be use to bring mood peak down and to improve sleep   someone once tell I medication be the ladder correct diagnosis be the step toward it but you be responsible for climb it the translation here be that you will have to put in effo to identify and fix problem or if there be none and honestly who have no oriblem then look at positive change in your life electronic device off before bed as I type this it be be in australia   oop force yourself to go to bed at a reasonable time force yourself to rest even if you can not fall asleep   try not to get wound up about not sleep and just enjoy the chillout force yourself to get up at a reasonable hour incorporate some exercise into your day an early morning walk be a great way to get yourself out of bed early to feel good straight away and to have achieve something before you have even staed what would be your normal day   watch your diet sugar stimulant coffee high calorie and highgi food lend themselves to buzz and crash scenario    the g in gp be for general it mean they have more knowledge than the average population on most medical topic but no specialist knowledge you should see a specialist in the case of this illness that would be a psychiatrist do not be ashamed it be normal people get sick it be an illness you be not crazy or faulty   share find some friend you can talk to about it I guarantee there be practically noone you see or work with that would say no if you say you be not do well and would like a chat   do not get catch in the this be I trap yes your illness be closely link to your personality and something you can not change but that do not mean you have to spend all your time on depression site or readingshare depressive meme I find that make the situation bad n you feel at first like it be good that soneone relate to you but on the whole you be just surround yourself with negativity focus on positive thing positive change and you will not only get well but you will actually be well than many normal people because you will learn a lot about yourself other people and tool for everyday life
get a referal to a psychiatrist I be diagnose around   mother also bp do not worry you will find the right med but antidepressant alone be no good for bp as they can get you manic if you be bp you will also need a mood stabaliser such as lithium good luck   
emily dickinson be far from successful   she be a recluse due to her struggle   and her work be largely unpublished during her lifetime
this be something I find myself repeat with people who be newly diagnose or not understanding of the illness you can still live your dream you will still have your passion and joy it dosent go away but it can make thing hard   learn your body track your mood pay attention to yourself and you will find what work and what dosent for you   even if you can only manage to work on something   minute a day that be   minute of work more than the day before I have always want to write fiction I be never encourage or suppoe and when I break under life pressure and my mental illness I feel it time to kill the dream then I meet my wonderful paner who find my note and half write story and tell I to keep go it be slow and I will not lie hard some day I finish my first novella after almost   year of labor and be now work on the sequel   I be honestly not the good writer thing be sometimes hard for I to convey I have   amazing friend beta read to help I may never make a full living off my work but that be never the point I have story in my head scream for life and I have a duty to provide it
people helping need to really understand this it be so easy to put on a mask when leave the house for sho period of time but that be not the whole story and most pain be below the surface it take allot of strength for the one be help and the helper to go below the surface it can be messy and stressful but in the end it can become very therapeutic have empathy not sympathy

I be hospitalize   day through police intervention the doctor finally tell I to answer just the question directly as he be try to decide if I be depressed or bipolar I be bipolar with depression that do not mean I do not have manic episode also steve wajda be correct bipolar med be a combination of many type some with harsh side effect and costly previously for   year my diagnosis be chronic depression with anxiety   I eventually become someone who I do not know existedvery angry and destructive along with manic spending spree my child become afraid of I as I look back at my history I can identify time when I be definitely show symptom of bipolar severe your awareness be a positive attribute and do not give up on get the proper diagnosis and help be persistent have someone close to you verify your situation also with your psychiatrist or therapist my husband do for I though I hate he at the time for do so
always difficult when dearle with depression and anxiety   I would not suggest another diagnosis until depression and anxiety be stable   once stable coaching of how to read what your body be tell you coach of way to increase strength coach for limit dramafear might even   stablize depression and anxiety more   I know someone who have stablize d   a and do not show any sign of bipolar today     bless youbreatherslow down but sleep breathe do what you love
I also use to think I have schizophrenia because of the rage that be inside I it use to make I that angry that I would attack myself and self destruct as much as I could and the thought that run through my mind be so sadistic and quite sicken but it be just pa of my borderline and come with my rage fit   I be past that now I no long feel suicidal when I have outburst and no long self destruct or self harm I can control my mood   time well than I use to all because I get the right help and the right treatment for my problem   med ever work for I so I force myself off of they I be now med free for my problem but I still take meazapine occasionally for sleep as I have bad insomnia   I find the only mer that ever do help with my anxiety depression and mood stabilisation be meazapine all the other I try make thing worse hard to deal with or turn I dumb   seroquel for instance literally cause I to sta stutter and lose my mind I could not even reply to someone when they ask I my name or date of bih because I could not remember I stae feel dumb and embarrassed so j stop take it and writhe   week I be myself again no more stuttering or forgetfulness   but all med work for different people I just do not ever reconnect seroquel to people because of my effect   it be trial and error with everything whether it be pill therapy or find the right person to diagnose you when one fail try and try again   goodluck with find the root of your problem so you can get the right help that you need   I hope you have some understanding soon
I have bpd and I use to think it be bipolar because I could not control my anger and would constantly have major rage fit and outburst but I be diagnose with bpd and I be now in dialectical behavioural therapy for it to learn to control my emotion it have save I from myself   I suffer from constant anxiety and depression along with unstable mood and constant fear of abandonment   it be hard to deal with but now that I know what my problem be learn about it come easily and be easy for I to help myself   but you need to be persistent with your psych and if they do not help you to find out your diagnosis than you need to keep try with other until you find one that will diagnose you   I try and try and I could not find the help I need until one night when I take myself to hospital to the psych ward very suicidal they have a proper psych come in and sit with I for   hour ask I all these different question about my past and present and my mood and anger trouble in a week he have I in proper therapy to figure out what be wrong with I and I be finally diagnose ever since I have make it priority to learn about my diagnosis and do everything I can to make myself well and change the way my mind process it be hard so hard but the more I keep do it the well I be become   I try medication after medication councillor after councillor psychiatrist after psychiatrist until I finally find one that I like and who give proper time for I and make sure to do everything in she will to help I she stae print out module of how to deal with distress intolerance and make I work through they and learn to control the way I react to my distressing situation make I work out what my trigger and warning sign be etc   I have come so far in only   month and I be proud of that but I know I be not yet where I want to be and still have a long way to go   but if it be not for I persist to get help the right help I would not be where I be today   you just need to be persistent yet patient at the same time   you will get there just keep try and do your good to find both a psychiatrist and psychologist whom not only help you to figure out your problem but also make you feel comfoable and able to talk about everything and anything that could help diagnose you   if you can not find one that help you feel like you be get somewhere with thing go to the hospital and admit yourself for assessment I have to to get the right help you do not need to stay there it be just for the right assessment instead of those k form that doctor fill out to diagnose depression and anxiety and stuff it be not that simple and it take a long time to dig deep to figure out the problem it can not take   minute     just keep try you will get there
mania or hypomania be what give you the diagnosis   for I it can be euphoria the world be a wonderful place and everybody be my friend it can also be rage irritability   your behaviour can be reckless financially sexually even drive the car you may believe you be the fountain of all knowledge you can accomplish anything you be unstoppable and that can include talk sleep be a good indication of mania you can get by with very little sometimes none
yes that be what my general doctor be worried about with my past history
I have be tell all I could take be zoloft I be   month pregnant and have be on zoloft for a while doctor recently up the dose for I since I be get bad again I have a mild bi polar disorder depression anxiety and ptsd zoloft keep I stable right now
I agree with everyone everyone be different and respond differently to different med it take I year to find what work for I I be bipolar   with anxiety and ptsd my psychiatrist have I on cymbalta geodon topamax and valium but everyone be different find what work for you and your symptom
I take effexor wellbutrin epival and seroquel   bp and anxiety disorder
I be dignose bi polar with bpd   year ago now I have not be able to find medication that do not make I feel like do self harm I give up on psychs and therapist and try to figure out med I try to manage my mental health myself I struggle on a daily basis I do not recommend this path to anyone
its take I   year to find the right doctor and right combination I be on prestiq and rexulti both of which I could not afford without the medication program through the pharmacy at the mental health clinic I go to I have severe anxiety and depression and since be on this combo I finally feel normal after many year of struggle you will get there just do not give up
everyone   and everyone be brain be different and what work for other may not work for you it will be trial and error recently after new clinical depressive episode I be put on seraline by a new doctor and in two week I feel much much bad I go back and insist on go back on to what have work for I before   citalaprim now three week later by brain have stop do the negative stuff and rumenate and the anxiety have leave I so try to describe to you doctor as accurately as you can your symptom and the degree you experience they the med be of course only pa of the solution life change and diet be far more beneficial although not discount the role of med in stabilise the bad vessel of brain emotional illness
my pet hate with bpd be the fear of rejection and the sense of abandonment that can be so intense whether found on fact or fiction
actually I have this issue I call this more to do with paranoia that can stem from any mental disorder and not bpd in itself this be not only bpd and from the this be write it come across strongly as if this be only bpd and a symptom
it be one of several characteristic of bpd it be not say this be the only symptom of bpd or that only people with bpd experience this just that this be a common to a lot of people with bpd and can be very destructive as well as upsetting for both other and for person with bpd especially as quite often be not base on reality but due to bpd and its effect on individual ability to process and regulate emotion and interpret other people
because it be still so little understand under research and you set fund and it be frightening   duh we need to stop call it mental illness and call it brain illness we do not call people with dementia or alzheimer mentally ill so why label other brain locate illness under this useless label
also I really think it be the name attach to it human be afraid of illness and when they hear the word it can tend to make one feel uncomfoable or powersless   and its human nature to fear what we do not understand
I be not really afraid of it I be more afraid of what other think of it that may sound well how it sound to another hehe and yes that cause I   little fear I just want to be love like everyone else even you
I know exactly how you feel I would never give advice or offer hope as I be conscious that every sufferer be unique just want to share that after misread medication I be now   week back on medication I have use before   citalaprim   and it appear to be work for I again and lift my mood enough to be able to get up face the day and do thing and laugh I hope your fog clear even a little if not on any med or if you be and they be not work go back to your gp also sleep insomniaanxiety meditation by lina grace have help I a great deal as well as other insight on youtube   andrew solomon on ted talk talk about depression other too the loneliness   or sense of it of the experience even if we have paner beside we be I find one of the hard symptom look for and seek the moment of respite however sho there be hope in they and in draw they out to long experience do what make you smile relax switch off distract you from your dark thought   e en if write on this fb page I have staed write   every day even if only a couple of sentence   my autobiography which will never be publish thought with you
in a world that teach you self doubt like yourself be a rebellious actgo on do it like yourself you need to be on your own sideif you think other do not like you the least you can do be like yourself please learn to adore who you areyou of all people should love yourself more than anyone else love you rebel you can
oh man how I have struggle with this with a very close friend of mine he isolate himself when he be depressed and I be an over giver one thing I have find helpful in maintain healthy boundary be to journal what I be think and feel during those time when I be really worried about he check in regularly but in a balanced way then when he seek suppo you can let he know some of the thing you be think
I be an isolator myself anxiety   depression for over a year now I just wish to be leave alone and for my friend to respect that unfounately I think they have forget about I I be not ready   to see they in person but it would be nice if they reach out every now   then
I would not like to judge because I have be in that bad place before but I hope you do not feel pressure into anything seem a bit like he want more from your relationship do not feel guilted into anything and remember this be not your responsibility but also try to help in a way that be not detrimental to your own mental health x x
I be not a professional and do not know the exact of your situation but   I will speak as someone who similar to your friend push everyone away with the intention to die alone he be not think straight while sick and desperately need you and need help even if he be mad at you now if he can get well he will understand and you will be close for it he be hue you to push you away not because he be actualy mad stay in his life be a sta though may not be enough if you be able to contact his therapist or doctor please do so and let they know what be go on and ask what you can do to help more try and find a way to ease his isolation as well you can try to get he to engage in activity with you there be also a program in many area refer to as a baker act I recomend it only as a last ditch effo if he be show sign of self harm or immediate danger it be drastic and harsh but if it save his life it be woh it
I have a major deal of it for almost   year if you leave he isolated he will go nuts and may do the wrong choice isolate I have do it be like be in your own jail   it be horrible
absolutely I struggle at work so by the time I get home I be in bed watch tv by   I can not stand be anywhere else I send to dose for an hr or two then wake but it be still well to be asleep even for a little while awake
yeah definitely I have depression and anxiety and I often fall asleep around   pm constantly worry about thing make we so tired
it be horrible be not it I have all these idea and thought in my head about how I could improve my life and get well but when it come down to it I be stuck and nothing change
this be great but as yenz have say it be so hard to do I would really love to do this anybody else struggle with it
I struggle to do all ov they lol just have sum to talk to with out they think be mad be bad anuf
anxiety attack be not only about fear
I have a massive panic attack once when out with my sister see someone who look like my abusive biological mom I tell she I need to find somewhere to hide for a bit she say she could see the panic on my face she help I find a hideaway then stand outside it to protect I while I get it under control when I come out she just ask if I be ok and we go on do what we be do b
panic attack be real   if you have never have one then you do not know   true or not they happen everyday
except my husband actually be leave I bad nightmare come true   but you know what I do not think my anxiety cause it I think I sense it and my anxiety skyrocket
and from the outside it be hard for those who care to tell that it be happen to those with anxiety then there be the person who be dependent on one person as be my down syndrome daughter to take care of they and know that when that person be go it be very likely that one one else will really give a damn about they that be not anxiety that be real and tragic and there be no cure or pill for real combine the nd situation with anxiety and it be crush
be glad you have the opposite of what happen to I never have that in my life and when I think I might have itthe person leftinsulte I and threaten to throw I in jail I would sell my soul to get just one person from your life in mine

I push everyone away and I get push out its my fault I know but I never lie to anybody that try to get close to I physically or mentally they have no idea it be that bad it always look easy to handle in book but when face directly on with this issue people get scared they do not know how I will act day to day so they walk on eggshell around I which I never pick up on people do not come near I because I be unpredictable I have never know this till recently I have no way to repair the damage that have be afflict to the countless peoplei try to fix it but I make it alot bad I have nobody to turn to because I be afraid of damage they as well

if only all that crap work you can not sleep you do not want to eator over eat and all wrong thing comfo food talk to someone people do not want to know about your anxiety issuesor so I have find so I keep to myself now   do not talk to anyone
if it be that easy none of we would have anxiety disorder
people be more likely to accept a physical illness than a mental illness because major depression bpd and other mental condition affect personality which can be see and be most likely unpredictable in other word it scare they
I do not blame ya     it hu so bad for I to deal with depression and anxiety       
this be quite simple let I put it this way what do most people fear the most   the answer be   their brain shut down and force to be dependent   they fear what they do not understand I will never understand the stigma   the brain should be the most focused on it be vital to run your body   be you people with I
rapid cycling be the bad and really leave you tired and confuse   I have no answer for you as I still suffer from it and it have never calm down really even with the med I do a lot of dbt with myself and that have help

lisa spivy azpilcueta kevin spivy if I have a nickel for every time you kid saidmom you just worry too muchand a dime for everyone else that say thati would be rich than trump
that sound like my friend at moment   about anxiety and depression
anxiety be not know what you want in your life
it be so truelam constantly tell to stop worry about everything   but they have no insight into the powerlessness of anxietyl guess that be why l work hard use the skill lve be teach and do a workout twice a day use my pacifica app and a great app call smile mind they give practical help to give I some empowerment over damm anxiety
I hate my med we have be try for year and just can not get it work out my bain be just wear out and I be tired of it but I be terrify to go off of they I have always bn medicated ugh
I fight against med for so long not really cuz of the stigma but because I get addict to thing very easy and I worry I would not be able to live off they then I staed to have massive panic attack several time a day and my husband beg I to please talk to the doctor about med so I stae zoloft I get damn lucky zoloft work for I right away I go on zoloft mainly because I be try to get pregnant and it be safe for pregnancy I be very lucky they work and make I stable
christopher l snead they be scary it take my   year to find the right now med   ow I have no bad side effect it be woh the trial amd error
med scare I I have take they before and the side effect be terrible
I have try mmj but it do not help I at all it be a strain for insomnia and depression and it help neither
and this be why cannabis should be legal because everyone be on horrible medication right now
buspar have be a godsent for my anxiety ativan only put I to sleep
I use it during the daytime for anxiety do not make you sleepy but calm your nerve
I take this while I be pregnant for a very brief amount of time it give I serious insomnia and for about   hour after every dose I feel like my anxiety be actually bad
my dr put I on escitalopram for my depression and buspirone for my anxiety from what I have hear buspirone be for anxiety I would double check with your dr but other than that buspirone be not that great the only way to break out of anxiety be to challenge yourself to talk to a person who you have never meet before a day small talk like hi or how your day be go I usually do this when I go to the store and talk a bit with the cashier when I be check out
I take wellbuin for a little bit it make I so irritable    spelling   I never take the other one
what be you on these for anxiety and depression it take at least   week to kick in still a mood stabilizer like lithium that handle both very well might be the well way to go slow release tablet mg a day   x mg tab
very much sound like anxiety attack but would recommend you see your health care professional
anxiety symptom sweethea you sound so much like mebut I have severe anxiety panic disorder I do not leave my home   go see your doctor and explain everything you say to we   you be definitely experience some anxiety there   a doctor will talk with you and let you know   and help you treat it   feel well soon   chin up and see that doctor
make a list each day of thing you need to get do and check they off when you wake you can see what be leave to do just a bit of organization and you will get the reality check you need to bring down your anxiety
seem like anxiety symptom
it sound like anxiety to meit the symptom
I become quickly addict to benzo after two week when I do not know about their side effect it take I six month to get off be careful with addictive anti anxiety med it be probably well that you do not take they in the long run I use depakote to get off of klonopin it work really well completely solve the withdrawal problem I be have
a good dr will only prescribe benzodiazepine as a last reso and only for sho period of time due to their addictive nature most antidepressant be also good for anxiety in long term busperine be also less additive and good for longterm management of anxiety   beta blocker can help with physical symptom drug like valium ativan should be use sparingly
my doc give with no problem she do however restrict to   a month I only use they as my rescue tab for severe anxiety I be on   anxiety tab a day which keep I quite stable
you need to go to hospital you can not stop suddenly your blood pressure please go to hospital
this seem to be the trend right now if you be lucky enough to even find a psychiatrist   one that be take patient it be very difficult to be take seriously in my area you either get the doc that throw anything at you but mostly the one who do the bare minimum I have be rely on herbal supplement like kava kava or valerian root to help my anxiety
that be a shame jessica because if you have a disorder that cause you to need it and be not abuse it you should be help my doctor be a really good listener I be diagnose with severe depression and severe anxiety panic disorder he want I on xanax but because of the junkie xanax have be remove from australia and doctor do not give out xanax but I be really really bad so he want I on increase dosage of valium he say it may take up to   each day to just calm I down my doctor care and listen   and a good doctor will look at your history your diagnosis previous suicide attempt they look over everything and look at you today and tell you what you will need if heshe flat out say no   that be not very good if she give a reason well yeah it be a hard one yes ceain prescribed drug be addictive but under the watchful eye of a good doctor and regular visit and take they as prescribe for your condition you be safe   because the doc can ween you off safely when it be time so sorry your have a shit time   candy
unfounately lot of doctor be that way because ativan can be addictive and they do not want we rely on it I be suppose to use my technique I learn at therapy to combat panic attack and depression
be she go to wean you off simply not renew can be very dangerous potential side effect of cold turkey be seizure hallucination and psychotic episode less side effect can be anxiety dizziness increase hea rate and headache if your doctor be force you to quit cold turkey get in to a different psychiatrist immediately
rest    proper diet and attempt to stay free of stress be key in recovery and maintain   a healthy balance
yes my mother deny my bipolar ptsd and anxiety for year she have finally accept it but still question my medication whenever I see she which be like   week out of the year

I have a   year old and a   month old I take buspar for a sho period of time during my pregnancy but it cause I severe insomnia which I have no problem before stae the med I be on lamictal when I find out I be pregnant and have to stop treatment my psych who be very experienced and well know in the mental medical community be not comfoable with any other option say he would try lithium but it be not something he practice so I would have to sign a waiver state I be aware of the possibility of complicationsdefect so I refuse and go without med I turn to aromatherapy orange be one of my favorite essential oil to help promote good mood but everyone be different both time I become pregnant it be unplanne though it happen both time during the spring which be a low stress period for my cycle
I be sure he be well aware that he need to be with his son and handle his finance smh his post be pretty much say he be struggle with that and would like some advice and suppo see that this be what this page be for your ignorance on everyone be post piss I off lady why you here to tell people to just calm down and shut up if thing be so simple we would just do it would not we   ugh anyway   to the man who write this post fonzie it truly must be hard be a father and struggle to provide   the weight of the world hey   I be so sorry your go through this   I be sure you be try your good sometimes the government can help in financial situation depend what country you live see your doctor may help you   some light medication and maybe some therapy mate sound like a tough time for you and I hope your relationship issue can be resolve it be hard but never give up

I be diagnose with bipolar anxiety and depression before get pregnant with my second child pregnancy I take my lamictal and other med and my psychiatrist say it be fine be a mom with these thing have its up and down and good day and bad day like most thing however a good strong suppo system and the right med make it possible and woh it good luck
total ball statement wish I could decide not to let my anxiety fuck my life up sometimes
this be offensive to people who already struggle with selfdefeate thought this contribute to the stigma you say you be try to fight
recovery be not always a choice otherwise we would be able to instantly pull ourselves out of depressive state or anxiety attack or panic attack
why be not you on an atypical anti psychotic at night to rest plus mood stabilizer to control anxiety and depression and benzodiazapine for spot relief
counselormy gp do not handle any of this   I ask for anxiety med and they do not want to do it till the lamictal sta do its job but it be not do anything and my breakdown be get bad   I do not know why they be not help I   I be make my next prescriber appt next week and go to keep try
I take mg lamictal in the morning along with mg estradiol mg ozcarbazepine and mg of tenex at night I still have my anxiety and depression swing so they add lorazepamtenex mg double if I need for my outbreak be on this cocktail for   yrs but still have my breakdown it do take time for your med to stabilize you but sound like you need to keep on your anxiety med keep explain to they have they read your journal find a doctoherapist be hard but find one that can relate to you be so impoant for you I call mine   my good friend     please hang in there and keep plug along you can win this battle I be here not an expe but have   yrs of experience battle this disorder talk to they ask they how can I get you to listen to I
I take mg lithium mg lamotrigine which be fairly new also mg quitiapine     mg diazepam and mg zoplicone a sleeping tablet I take they all at night and when I take they I almost instantly feel soo dizzy and if I do not lie down immediately I be staggering about the place yet I be have real difficulty sleep I think it be get something to do with lamotrigine but since my psychiatrist leave after   year all I get be locum and they do not seem to listen and just up lamotrigine and quitiapine I do not think I be on the right med but they do not really listen and I be scared to rock the boat incase they give I something that will increase my weight so I be in a catch   as I have not be in hospitalfor two year and do not want to go back but my mood be more down than up x
the lamictal be a good long term preventative for depression but not so good sho term have you try a mood stabilizer like tegretol or lithium or do you have just depression   due to recent law change prescription for potentially addictive drug like sleep med and anxiety med now be strictly control and they just do not give as many of they   maybe you need an antidepressant as well
that be horrible   I be sorry to hear that
they tell I this be a mood stabilizeri tell she I need something for in the moment breakdown and she say let we get this up to a good dosage first and see if you need something after thati be scared and not very authoritive

I have ssdi for bipolar I that be diagnose   year ago I have have multiple hospital stay s s last time I be manic I get arrest twice for suspicion of be on meth they throw I in jail instead of take I to mental health dumb ass cop but I digress I have also have a lot of health problem I guess it be just the combination of everything that get I approve on the first try that be the exception and not the rule though most people get deny   time and end up have to go to cou it be a long haul
bp gad ptsd insomnia panic disorder agoraphobia   recently diagnose with hashimotos    after work   year have not work the past three no disability

work might be triggerre your depression anxiety at the moment mean you might need to go on sick leave for awhile and work on yourself I do not think not work will benefit you in the long run I do not know what you do but think about another job if it be the job you be do that be specifically cause issue I do not know where you be from I be in uk and I work and get a ceain amount of pay sick leave however the pay by my work but I be of over a year from july   to august   and receive benefit as I be on half pay and then no pay for month but benefit a lot less than my pay   its unlikely you would be put on permanent disability benefit which be sound like your suggest you would need to be seriously ill in hospital and unable to do anything for yourself or even talk to irger people to not be able to work I have bpd bp as well as anxiety and depression and I also have physical long term health condition as there be time as I have mention when I be unable to work and on sick leave but when thing improve I be able to return and my work be suppoive you also need to be actively and on continuous treatment by a dr and medication who you can show and who will sat why you can not work
I receive approval for bipolar and anxiety   I read the social security blue book chapter   and fill out my paperwork base on my document medical problem
I have bp with mania do not know if that be one or two also other thing ptsd fibromialga anxiety an I have disability
yes everyone be case be differentmy anxiety bipolar come my my eplipsey surgery in I have   apply in and get it within month on my own with my doctor and family   suppoi have   tryi do have   pay pillsand live
I have talk about this before it be all about your history and what you can show they you must have clear documentation I go with a very good and kind lawyer who review my case and help I every step of the way you must fill out your initial application on line and answer the question in a specific way or you will be reject automatically then you must have documentation from every doctor and hospital that have ever treat you as well as those therapist you have see then you will also have to fill out a questionnaire about yourself that you must be very honest and open about it be brutal then a family member or spouse must also answer concern mine be my sister and nearly break I to read it but it be the truth   so basically you must have all your duck in a row I be come up on my   year review   in   I do not even know if I will still have benefit but I do know that I need to sta get prepare now and it scare the shit out of I   some of you think it would be well to stick it out and not be at home but my former employer do not understand my frequent need to be away from work and really they need you there and count on you as well as your fellow worker to be there it be not a commitment that I can give a company that I will be able to work full or even pa time because I do not know when my symptom will smack I down or when a manic or depressive cycle begin because mine come in rapid cycle it be terrify for I when I do not recognize it happen to stop the process   and what will happen if an employer see this I have a horrible experience in my last job where my supervisor be afraid of I and refuse to meet alone with I all because of her misconception of bpd so think long and hard before you begin the process of apply for ssdi   it be not as easy as you think
this year the rule be change so most people will no long be award money for depression and anxiety you have to be very very bad now and be receive a lot of treatment and say lose you be kid for not be able to care for they then you will be able to get it otherwise   be go to loose benefit good thing you can do it go get help like therapy trust I if you leave work you will feel bad off as their be nothing occupy you be mind its very isolating be at home speak to the wellbee clinic they be wonderful its all a free service and they can do so much to help so you can feel back in control again its a hard road but you have to just keep go a step at a time I wish you all the good you do not need a dr by the way to see wellbee you can refute urself which be wonderful x

med be an impoant pa of your well being but one of threethe other two be   therapy and   a positive influencer in your life both be a challenge to find good doc for the med and good therapist for your behaviorsthinking be too few and many time overwhelmed yet they be essential as for the influencehink of they as a cheerleader or a mentor someone whom both encourage and assist you with good thing in your life daily if possible look I up on fb if you think I could be of help
do not stop your med unfounately they be not a cure they will help you feel well for a while and then your mood can shift you may need a med change but therapy like dbt dialectical behaviour therapy may be really useful learning to manage your mood change can be really helpful and make they less frightening talk to your doctor I hope all go well
I do not know what med or med you be on I hope a good mood stabilizer like lithium at a dose like mg talk to your doctor about anti psychotic at night to rest your brain and give you regular sleep and both these type of drug help with anxiety
a little break in life for I be   year of isolation very bad I be bipolar withe anxiety and ptsd and on top of that I be an alcoholic in recovery
